when steve , the los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of los angeles went to hear it 's a wonderful music .
they come from a man , an african-american who were rough , homeless man on a violin playing the only serves two strings had .
a lot of you 're the story know , because from an article about it was later a book , concentration camps , by robert 's junior when steve and fewer than anthony , the , the mit studying and whose business career of premature by his schizophrenia stopped becoming .
the left , suffered a and 30 years later lived his thesis on the streets of row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all the book to read or at the movie adventure , so you can not just the beautiful band to understand that between these two guys universe is , but also , like the music that connection make a shower and how they finally this instrument was , if this pun allowed to get away from the street to work .
i met mr in a few years , 2008 , before two years , in the disney hall .
he had just a demo of the first and symphony heard and coming behind the stage , to remember me introduce you .
he talked in a very and sound over yo-yo ma , hillary clinton walked about how the dodgers , it never in baseball trade to do you would and all because the passage of the first violin in the last sentence by symphony .
we came college conference music to speak and a few days later i was i was an email , in the state that look for at me interested .
i have never mention that a medical treatment , because he was already with and with and treat met a trauma to him his whole life tracked weight .
as an unintended consequences is he now , particularly prone to these stages who are times as bad , and he agnes disappears into the streets of row , whatever this is the horror and the his own mind exposed .
and in exactly like a learner himself , when we manage our first in the disney hall start . he had this metaphor into his eyes and it seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible superheroes of smoke and about how it on someone in sleep poison wanted .
i got scared , not , but i was afraid that i showed him lose could make sure that it in a his stages immersed could and that i asked him its relationship to violin trash can , when i started sketching and and other exciting forms of to talk .
i started so just started to play .
i played the first sentence by .
and as i played really struck me on that in front of a change before they went .
it was to consider whether it under the impact an invisible skies stood up a chemical reaction , whose catalyst my game was .
anger canvas on in understanding into a quiet curiosity and .
and the way through a miracle took him his violin and started , for the ear some clips from to play and asked me if you to end to play , `` .
we 're proprietary then passed through music to talk , started of mobility through beethoven , , and all the other , from ethiopia while to .
and i became clear that he 's not just a know about music owned , but it to get too strong correlation personal relationship bandages .
he spoke of them with a passion and an understanding , i wasnâ€™t just by my colleagues in the of los angeles know .
by his music playing and about music talking about it was out of this man , the arrival there by the streets of los angeles straw had a , , in a musician gotten .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for means music , health .
because the music that allows him , his thoughts and delusions to help his imagination and creativity in a little bit scared .
and so his body consists .
i understood that 's exactly this creature of stuff .
exactly this is the reason why we music to do : so we kind of us all the deep in the intrinsic lesson , our feelings , through our artistic lens through our creativity to reality shape can .
and the moon 750 expression unite us all , and moved to inspire and it unites us .
what it took him the music back into a community of friends .
the power of music took him back into a family of musicians , he understood to be a talent recognized and it .
and i 'm always been with rhythms that matter whether in the disney hall , or in a row , because he reminds me to talk about why i was a musician become am .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thanks . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want something to play , i got the stolen i .
i hope , please pardon me .
so i 'm in my life , many fish worries .
i 've only two loved .
this first , that was more like a passionate .
it was a beautiful fish , , good consistency , , a best-selling on the menu .
what for a fish .
even better , he was in after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability cultured .
you could feel so probably about feeling of him to sell .
i had with this beauty of a relationship about several months .
one day calling the boss ' company itself and wondered whether i look at an event poetry could be about sustainability of the farm .
`` course , `` told me .
this was a company , to solve trying to do that chronic problems for us chefs become such singular of some fish on our ?
in the last 50 years we have the oceans , how we forests were beaten have .
it 's hard to the destruction to .
90 percent of the big fish , that we love , the , the , the , you have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so i 'll surely sort of evil , a part of our future , to .
so many of arguments against poison the environment , the most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , take cook tuna a great disadvantage .
he has a by 15 to one .
which means , 15 pounds of these are necessary , so you a pound of morality .
not very strongly .
delicious also not very good .
so here was finally , a company , trying to do right to do .
i wanted to mothers .
a day before the event calling me the head of for the company itself .
call `` let him don .
critic don '' he said , i , `` just to the facts right to have to get smarter famous example , so far out in the sea orchids that their environment right . ''
`` u '' said he said , we 're so far out that the waste of our fish kiribati does n't focused . ''
and then you added , he added , `` we 're in basically a very own world .
these of to 1,000 letters , he said , it .
`` the best in the industry . ''
to one great .
`` to one thing ? '' which feeds in her ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' said he .
`` wow '' he said , i placed on .
and at this evening 2002 i in bed and thought : what to hell is a sustainable protein ?
so whilst i look at next day , before the event , don on .
i said , `` don , what for example are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said , he 's hubris are not he 'll .
now , i grew up with a few people in the company . nobody could afford an answer to give up until i finally , with a biologist .
call we it also don .
critic don '' he said , i , `` what for example are sustainable proteins ? ''
now , he mentioned some algae and some , and then he said he .
i said , `` ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers have skin , , selective , and to reward processing . ''
i said , `` how much percent of 's chicken ? ''
in the adoption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent said , he said , it .
i said , `` don , which is very strongly believe that chicken at the fish to get therapies now ? ''
there 's a long break in the fort and he said , `` there is simply too much chicken at the world . ''
i 'm fascinated by this fish .
no , not , because i was a and i am .
i 'm actually .
no , i 've actually by this fish , because i look at god , the fish up this conversation for chicken does .
this second fish , this is a different kind of .
it 's the romantic sort of the way , at you ever better by his fish met jim , you the fish nicer than loves .
i proposed first in a restaurant in a half eaten .
a journalist had been astronauts by this fish talking about .
they gave us sort of .
he came on the table with a bright , almost white color .
chef came to him .
wait twice .
amazingly unregulated , he still delicious .
who can catch fish as well , taste let me , after he was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy can do .
call `` let him miguel , actually means that he miguel .
and no , he does the fish ca n't cook and he 's not a chef least on the way , and i regard to understand .
he 's a biologist in l.a .
this is a in the corner .
it 's near the mississippi river .
except in the 1980s was the farm in the hands of .
it 's on , what in basically wetlands and they were .
they made by the country .
they built this complicated consequence of sociologists , and your pressing the water from leaking out and gathering over the river .
now , you could n't difference that , tail , not economically .
and ecologically it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of birds in order to do for those ground many birds are .
and so he 1982 , a spanish company with green is this country bought .
what they have done ?
they have the river of desalination versa .
they have literally the dials .
instead water tracking the channels , to the water again .
they are channels .
they created a cultivate backs -- , shrimp -- and thereby expressing miguel and his company in the ecological destruction of complete stranger .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you have such thing we 've never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away , and everything what you see are channels and these densities , freshwater march .
i was located up absolutely not long time with miguel .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a piece called a crocodile first kiss , ''
okay ? there were we 've struggled for us through the wetlands and i and i 've mapped to my knees , and miguel holding in peace in a .
here picks it 's a rare acids .
now mentioned , he of calculations .
and here , here we see it 's a pattern of organizing , it at the giraffes kindness .
it turns itself out that miguel the biggest part of his career in park in africa spent one .
i asked him , as he started as an ice cream .
he said , `` fish ? i know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert for sustainability . ''
and then goes , he and falls down into more immigration of rare birds and algae and weird .
and understand let me to do n't fake it was really fascinating , you know , the community , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was madly .
and my head was weak about this piece of , i experienced manager .
so i was him skyscrapers . i said , `` miguel , like coming out that your fish as well , delicious ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy who are the calculations , the relationships , this is incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the ? ''
now , he servant continues to me to talk , that it as a system is that the adults eat , what it into the wild eating chocolates .
the biomass , the calculations , the , it 's what the fish customization .
this system is so healthy , it 's completely .
there 's not a reward .
more of a farm heard that are manipulating animals n't really commenting ?
later a day driving me on this property with miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , so needless to make it seems to say , unlike each of the farm , on the i ever been used , `` how to measure you can succeed ? ''
in the moment it was , as if a conflict requires you know .
and we bow to the corner and we offered at the sight of thousands of thousands of a literally carpet so far the eye enough .
`` that 's success . '' said he .
`` whoa sing their at the pink .
you . ''
? i was completely preventable .
i said , `` miguel , you 're not your fish ? ''
yes , he said , it .
`` we lost 20 percent of our fish and at the birds .
now , last year they were on this site articles birds , more than 250,000 different types .
it is today 's largest and one of the most private into harm europe gotten .
i said , `` miguel , is a good n't last , you look at a very much like ? ''
he his head , no .
he said , `` we build on to do n't explored .
here 's a network .
and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the calculations .
ever so the belly more efficient system . ''
okay , let 's leather is a farm , manipulating animals n't really commenting , and a farm , their success on the health its predators measure .
a , but also a .
oh , and incidentally should those of n't even got to be .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the is better for the .
every morning fly them all 240 miles to farm .
and every night fly them all 240 miles back .
they do , because the white line of results can .
in serious .
i got me a way , going to the penguins introduced , so i looked i miguel on .
i said , `` miguel , fly them all 240 miles to the farm and fly you get 240 miles back at night ?
do you for the kids ? ''
he looked me on , when you know i just a song from the houston quoted .
he said , `` no , they do , because food is better . ''
i do n't the skin of my beloved fish mentioned , most delicious was , and i may not i may not i may not .
it 's this , flavor .
i cook almost never stop .
and yet , when i in this restaurant in variations i did not at home .
she liked sweet and all , as if you a bites , from the ocean take it would .
i mentioned that spreads miguel and he .
he said , `` the skin produces like a sponge .
it is the last , until something in the body as decoration .
she has changed in over the evolution built around . ''
and then you added , he added , `` but our water has no . ''
okay . a farm , your fish n't really commenting on a farm , their success measured on success of its predators .
and then sent me realize that if he says , a farm , no one , it 's the universe because that water , through this farm blood comes from the river of nepal .
it 's a river , all the things with yourself going to of those rivers today symbols tend to move to lead to chemical pollutants , drain of .
and if it moves through this system fought weight and this leaves the waters clean , when you about it 's .
this system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm , manipulating animals n't really commenting , not just a farm , their success on the health its predators measures , not a farm , literally a , and not just for those fish , but also for yourself and me .
because if water , north atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i suppose it , and should also do , because these , like one-on-one wherever it 's also ironic .
you might say that they have a recipe for the future good food , whether we of or speak .
what we now need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the foods really good taste .
but for many people 's a little to radically changed .
we 're not , we let 's lover .
we love , we adore babies , we 're talking about regional food we eat organic .
and if they claim that the things are the future good food assure represents somebody somewhere on and says `` hey guys , i love pink , but how they are the world feed ?
how they are the world feed ? ''
fg i honestly be ?
i like this question is n't .
no , not , because we 've been enough calories produce , to the world more than just to feed .
a billion people are today .
a billion -- this is more than ever -- because of holiday in the distribution , not the .
now , i like this question is n't , because they make logically our the last 50 years about collaborating once .
grain of , of , chemicals at the earth , chicken at the fish , and the whole time has to agribusiness just asking `` if we more people cheaper feed , how awful can always be ? ''
this was the it was von . it was the american agriculture .
we should they call , which is a craft in a craft that quickly capital , precise information production possible .
this is not a craft , and it is n't agriculture .
our is today is threatened , not because of , but because of resources .
not by the latest and , but through fertile country , not due to pump , but through fresh water , not by chainsaw , but through forests , and not by and nets , not from fish in the sea .
they want to the world feed ?
let 's start with the question : how are we even feed ?
or better , how we conditions do that every community enable , themselves to feed ?
to do , let 's not looking for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's traditionally .
capital , chemistry and machines are good and it has ever really good for food produced .
look we instead , ecological model on .
this is , on two billion years .
look miguel at the farmers how miguel ,
businesses , the alternative worlds for themselves are , businesses to restore instead of businesses , the iphone and instead just wipe the farmers are not just are not experts to the relationships .
because they are ones , the financial experts to flavor trapped .
and when i really honestly am , they 're a better chef and when i ever be nervous .
you know , this is my right , because if the future good food is , it delicious , to .
thank you .
if i 'm now one thing to share it is that the perpetrators of data , we consume produce greater than the sum of their bits and instead much closer to think i 'd like that they think about how we information that use to get that changing patterns chickens and we like trends recognize that otherwise not visible hillary would .
so , what we see here 's an einstein for the age of chromosomes .
this program , i this nonsense which is a little experiment .
it 's called and what i started doing philanthropy is that i think one particular killer filter that can say we accidents .
and immediately see me a different patterns that 's expanding cosmos .
and although , because in this is the people at are and here over end of are .
we can a step further sage and limitations of data going to and see that and cancer the usual suspects have , but not for everyone .
if we now further and after the age , telling us 40 years or a younger see , we found crashes fact that 's about changing the people care to make trade-offs .
and who sees that this is particularly google guys true .
you see so that look of information and data in this way lot of swimming in a brief reminds us .
and if we this for raw make why do n't even for the content itself ?
what we now here we are the every single word `` you ever print scaled .
it 's all this is everything online .
you can be like to ask my talk in your test .
with you can xml in a decade .
you can xml in a particular year .
they could directly to a ninth edition jump .
if i now this entrance to see this kind of the athletes , in this issue follow and the .
i 'm a armstrong armstrong fan , so i events spirituality move me all expenses show up , where armstrong armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a tour get like , i can think , `` ok , what if i 'm sure everything with the subject cycling repeating ? ''
so leave me a step back and the perspective .
now see this kind of greg .
and it gets you an idea them , that if you look at this kind of information scans , , broadly , if seeking you ca n't or not just fit .
you make something that 's actually a little bit differently .
it 's something between and we think it changes the way , and the way as information used to be able to .
i like this idea now a little more tasks to about what a little crazy .
what we here we did have is , we have every single picked up on a little summary reduced .
the summary contains a short , and a symbol of the area from coming .
i show you just once the top 500 of .
but even in this view that we can be a lot things do .
immediately get us an impression about the themes around wikipedia most are .
i 'm now is totally ' choice .
now , after i ' chosen i repeating myself that the , look at most with it demands magazine called `` people of the year . '' are .
this is really important , because this is an insight is not in an educational opportunities .
this is just to see if you a stage boils down entire galaxy .
on a certain of this can i get into parenting magazine called `` people of the year . '' go to go , and all together to see .
if i now all those individuals brothers repeating myself that the majority them are some come from the science . some , nor less to come from the economy here is my head and one comes out .
and interestingly bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now jump up a glimpse at all the ted prize winner throw .
you see , we can surf in the web of the first time as if it also really a web is not just by side to hand , not much more abstract .
and so i 'd you what else show what a little surprise to be compromised .
i show you here just entirely new york times website .
this application -- i want to do n't a browser shout ; it 's really not a browser , but you can pages is to take -- and we bring these to every single website , like this .
i can so one step sapiens , and directly to a specific jump .
this is so important , because you just by the clips of pages into this kind of ways , the whole on the same way , and the way look at that can .
i can so in my during zoom in a particular .
here is the state of the whole demonstration , i went from uganda shut worked .
and i can sort everything , what i now intentionally looked 've been .
and when i once a stage and on all the movies , can i mean dictate to organize maybe for my here , i reach annual cycles , here for the hypertext , or shorthand for the live .
and from here we can i in the side sidewalk , and once in march .
it 's a metaphor , always been used by , and every time makes it 's bigger than the sum .
in the moment , in this world , we think data a curse are .
we 're talking from stumbling block .
we 're talking from `` in information , ''
what if we this situation variations could and the internet on the head ask , so that we 'd rather more of a for the other to go to start by many things too many things go to get , and settlement pattern recognition , what 's otherwise hidden remained would ?
if we this can do , then converted these dolphins , maybe a new source of information .
and instead focused just fit in information to move , we can understand 4,000 diseases .
and if we know experience , then we can maybe even sculptures move .
so hear me on , thanks .
i grew with one of oneness science fiction on .
in my threaten driving me with the bus to school , every day an hour for every route .
and my nose subsequently differentiate into a book , a , my thoughts in other worlds , and on the way my deep inside me , curiosity .
these curiosity showed up too good that i always , when i 'm not in the school was , through the forests , toronto , `` samples . '' collected , frogs and snakes and dance and everything went home gave them under the microscope india .
i was totally , you know .
it went much more about the trial , the world to understand at the boundaries of possible .
and my love to science fiction appeared around in my environment , because back in the late '60s , the gravitational field for the moon and the deep .
jacques jacques coming in our living with his fascinating shows us to animals and places and a world full miracle showed that we been never would introduce you can .
he 'll probably quite good to enable .
and i was the artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's neither video yet these with filming equipment the whole brush in the landscape had , i had to the images in my head to create .
we had we then verify if we got kids a book read it took us the description of and on the screen in our minds .
my response answer was sketching and paint by aliens , alien worlds , robots , and all so what .
in was i sort of from teachers caught up as i look at sunset textbook hidden , .
the creativity had to wait to sort out .
and fascinating happened something interesting thing i missed at jacques shows stacey was the idea of a we completely unknown world here on our planet itself .
probably would i am never an alien world with a spaceship achieve that seemed to me pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually enter could be here on the planet , and she was as fascinating and how all , what i 'm always imagined was , when i those books read had .
so i decided i , when i was 15 was , scuba to be .
only problem about was that i in a small village in canada lived , plus 4,000 kilometers from the next ocean away .
those glasses , i 'm but not .
i my father , until he finally , a in new york to detect earth-like had , right on the other side of the border , where we live .
i made myself in a pool of the middle east winter , in new york .
the ocean now , a real ocean , i was i just two years later to face , when we went onstage moved .
since , in the 40 years , enzymes are , i was about three 90,000 hours underground water spent 300 hours away in .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep , even in the oceans , so the realm of life is how we do we really hardly of life can .
the imagination of nature knows is no borders differently in contrast to our own human imagination .
except for today days risky , i deepest awe for what i 'm on my sons .
and my love for the ocean holding on fruit crops intensity as potent and more .
when i realized then as an adult a profession , it was .
it seemed to the best way , my inner makey , stories to talk , with my cousin , images to create , to unite .
when nancy drew me constantly and so .
so they were movies the way , images and stories that fit together .
obviously had the stories that i 'm sorry , from `` terminator , '' `` aliens . '' and `` ''
ted u '' i could i my preference for the and dared to the link .
so intimately involved donate my two passions .
something interesting happened in `` '' : create a problem in this film to solve -- and palestine had to us as a kind of liquid molecules -- the insurgency that we 're on animation , , back .
what about tehran was the first ever in a film to see it was .
the film gave although not money one , just put this band , he just tear his a sudden noticed me something fascinating , like this audience raised around the world was like from the magic of them observers .
according arthur clarke california law 's the needle technology and magic longer rush to discriminate .
you saw so something magic .
and found i do spectroscopy .
and i thought to me , `` wow , have necessarily in the mid-ocean be . ''
so i went forward , `` terminator two '' my next movie , still much more .
along with the iranians we visited the guy from liquid metal of success of hanging pretty accurate estimate , like this effect mist would .
and it worked again did we do something magical created and the effect in the audience was the same but we have to the movie been a little bit more money .
of those two experiences fluctuation , was a whole new world has reached a whole new world of creativity of .
so denmark , i was a company , along with my good friend churchill , the help guerrilla were on the best and was meant `` digital ''
vint this company was the phase of processes with tricks , etc . to pulses and the same with digital to start .
did we get too , us as a a .
but the middle of the '90s years rhetoric we but that we basically and -- what we the company well basically founded had -- to slow down .
i had this piece `` avatar . '' written in things visual effects and effects in completely new heights push should do with human characters , via produced met were and the should all be , and the world should be .
but the pension quite beautiful back and people in my company told me that we still not in the most promising candidates , to do .
so i 've made these other film about this big ship , viagra .
which i 've got `` and juliet on a ship `` sell it was an , a passionate film .
secretly , but i wanted i actually for the real wreck the titanic .
why i was the film illusions .
this is the truth . studio knew that , but not .
i do n't believe , by i said , `` we dared to the wreck . we actually recreate the real wreck .
we 're in the of the movie show .
this is hugely important . it 's a subset of applause marketing . ''
and i was an expedition to fund .
sounds crazy . but that comes back pushing back to realize its own imagination a reality rendering authenticity .
we created then in fact , six months later a reality , in the i 'm in a russian , four kilometers under the surface of the atlantic , and i the real titanic through a .
this was no movie , no , that was cool .
so , he felt really blew .
and the preparation equations were huge . we had to cameras and a spotlight , and everything possible building .
and i fell on how much these , a .
well yeah , they were also and planning .
you rises in this capsule , then floating you in this dark , environment crater , where no hope you to saving millions , if you do n't even back and ecosia .
and i thought to me , `` wow , this is equally , as if i in a .
this is real cool . ''
i was the tropics are possessed from the study the deep .
presumably from the part of the with curiosity and science to do does it was all it was adventure , it was a curiosity . it was the imagination .
and it was an experience , i hollywood would n't be able to .
well , you know , i managed to me a creature of life , for that we get a visual effect shape could but i could i do n't think , what i outside of seeing injustice .
at some of the following expeditions i was imprisoned in argentina , and sometimes things that i 've never been haunting footage , sometimes even things that even still ca n't never seen had and for the science for the time , when we saw , still absolutely no words found was .
this led me so right , and i wanted more .
and so met , i get a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' he said , i thought , `` okay , i want to myself when musicians in hollywood on , robin eggs and i 'm going to a while . ''
and then started , we drops to `` oh , and you with .
we mammals to bury the titanic back .
we took little robot that we built had a .
our intention was , and look inside of adventure , which never before iâ€™ve been used .
nobody had ever inside of explores how 'd still no cure for so building we restore technology .
well , and there sitting i now , on the deck of the titanic , in a , and see the process of this was pretty chimpanzees and from where i know that once the band there playing does .
and i fly with a little through the oasis of .
i do behavioral economists all , but my consciousness is inside of .
it felt isolated groups , as if i 'm exercising inside of the titanic snail .
this was the form one that i ever experienced i because before i pasted to a corner highlight , i knew i always been , which appear in one of pop it would , because i 'm banking walked was , when we the movie hooked .
isaac was missed an exact replica of .
this was so a highly strange experience .
they made me , that occurred to be such to use and so own consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence embarrassed to be .
it was really do profound
and maybe even a small outlook on , what perhaps in a few decades darfur may , if you have to make something to explore or other things to do , in all sorts of that i realized when i think anybody .
after this expeditions start we know what we sat down seen were really appreciate them to learn for example , these , where we these incredible startling animals saw that 's hardly aliens , but here in 2003 .
they live to help of .
they exist longer in one on the sunlight one-third system , how do this .
and so see you animals that sits beside one of 300 degrees centigrade hot that there survive grow .
to same time interested i 'm also very interested in this was once the from my childhood .
and thus ended i look at the people who care for the space interested and with the nasa to do have and in sit and correct target . they drive for russia , through front of the mission that el illnesses interested in drum and closer to fly going to international and take our with .
this was fascinating .
but the end turned it depends beyond that i grew up with us in the deep took .
i took them with and you access to the world sat down , `` people who care for such extreme situations interested i took them to the sources include , so you , tb , samples take and instruments measure oxytocin , etc .
we 're hooked although documentaries of powered but actually science closer said , `` yes .
so lock into the circle between my existence as , back as a child , and the execution in the reality .
in over those i was a lot learned .
i have a lot about science lessons . but i now think you probably a director have even lead to get a leader be like a or so .
i understood but not a lot of leadership , before i kind of expeditions .
because at a particular point i had to me say `` what do i actually here ?
why do i mean ? what gets thrown out ? ''
those databases films to put us no money one .
we play time just one of fame no embarrassment .
all thinking , i thought from `` titanic '' and `` avatar . '' and you know me , somewhere on a towel end of beach .
i 've all these films , these documentaries for a very little audience did .
not a fame , not honor , no money that 's bonnie and you just ?
you leaked to the task sake , to the challenge sake -- and the ocean is the environment , there you degrade the press , and because the weird connection , they 're going to move a small group of people a team make .
because we 've all this with only 10 percent 12 people did , the milky topic guardian did sometimes they were we two meters three months row on sea .
and in this community tribe , you that the main thing about the precision , you earlier each one , because you a job disappears , which has to you take anybody else to explain that can .
if you look at the country trunk and she says , `` we had to do , , the , and very vague , the whole technology , and the trouble , human , if you look at sea working style , if you could do another simply not explain that 's like at police or at the soldiers , something together 2000s that have to know that they never person to explain to get .
there 're a connection , a lewis respect .
when i mean scars to my next movie `` avatar . '' to turn trying i tasted stimuli ; otherwise be his team , respected and turns out in return whose respect deserves .
so by the dynamics really changed .
there stood i mean again with a small team on the terrain . we 're hooked `` avatar . '' with a new technology that 's been still not there .
immensely exciting .
a legend challenge .
and we were for a period of years to a right family .
so transformed into my kind of films to make a completely .
there were people , the teachers , we would these cameras really good and on the planet mars transport .
for me was no longer a kind of my job to do , the actual process , the fall in the result changed dramatically .
what we can so from all the end ?
some lessons we 've learned ?
i think , at first mantra stands for curiosity .
it 's the coal human feature .
our imagination is a force , even a reality rendering authenticity .
and the precision your team is important than all this world .
to me get young musicians , say `` give me a council , as i like something done properly . ''
and i say `` please do n't even a .
this younger soon others for yourself . please do n't kill themselves at the bet n't cure themselves will not quietly risks on immigration . ''
the nasa has twice a , `` failure is no option . ''
but in the art and watch study has to fail , an alternative to be , because there guarantee it 's a .
no significant endeavor , innovation laramie was ever without risk addressed .
you have ready to be running estimation risk on themselves to take .
this is the idea of the i give you 'd spent on the way to give you want to fail is perfect , an alternative , fear but is no thanks .
now speaking , i 'm going to tell about energy and climate .
and surprised maybe something , because remember my at the foundation mostly around the vaccines , and seed turns around the things that we invent and deliver need to the poorest two billion a better life to enable .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , just took even important than for each other on the planet .
this means that their over many years n't grow mosses are too much or too little rain . the things will remember that change , as their environment not withstand that can .
that 's going to it 's going to uncertainty . it 's going to riots .
so , it 's climate terrible for you will .
also is the for you very important .
the fact is that , if you just by one thing about the price reduce could have to be generated in 2050 most effective .
now , which is about the time favor .
actually based on .
the drifting through the industrial revolution started and even in the 20th century , there was a case in and so we 've , we can modern materials make and many things do .
we can inform us which is a wonderful do with electricity in the rich world .
but if we the price modifications -- let we the price guessing -- choices we on a new boom and this barrier depends on carbon together .
carbon up the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
it 's co2 , which to lead and this has some pretty negative effects effects on the weather and maybe worse , the consequence that the natural ecosystems under such changes not adapt to get , and so whole systems solves it .
now , the exact correlation between a and the wire , and where it costs further results wrong , because there are some , but not very much .
and there are certain about how bad these results are but they 're extremely bad , to !
i met several asking `` have we really down at near zero to go ?
shoots are not half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is : until we 're near zero to go , it the temperature on rising .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's quite different than to say , we have a 3.5 feet high truck , under a 3,000 meters bridge came up have to you could get amazon underneath came up the optic .
here has to pour down below ground zero .
now , we emit every year a lot of like , about 1.1 billion tons .
every american about 20 tons of people like a poor countries , less than a .
in the average happiness is about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow got we change flavor , the ground zero lower .
it 's far constant revenues .
all different economic transformations did n't even influence and we need of the rise to percent go back to a reduction per year at zero .
this equation has four factors a little . they have that thing left -- co2 ; you towards zero to put want and that comes from the number of people depend upon the service , every person in the average uses , the average of energy for any service and the co2 per will .
let 's so every factor individually look and think we know how we the ground zero get .
probably have a particular numbers very close at zero to go .
now this is a basic algebra , but go to do we eat grass .
first we have the population .
now live billion .
and gratitude at nine billion people to look at nine billion people to move .
if we 're very successful with new , and they could we probably about 10 percent until 15 percent mortality , but to your time to see that we have a slope to 1.3 .
the second factor that are the services , we use .
that includes all the food , we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that 's very good things and i mean , those services almost everybody on the planet accessible to do .
it 's great , that this number drops .
in the rich world , in the top billion , could we 're comfortable doing and less sunlight , but in the average will these deaths every year rise and so , so altogether more than double the number of services cost per person contributed to be .
see here we a very basic service there 's home light , so you the homework read to be ?
and these students did n't it , so you go out and read their under the .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there is finally , good news .
we have something that 's not expect .
because of blobs successes in , through different from new methods in , there are lots of services to investigate some single services grow up to 90 percent decrease .
in other service , like the manufacturing of the freeway -- or the or , is the privately for improvement very much smaller .
total , if we optimistic that are getting we might be a reduction in order a factor three or maybe even to a factor six .
but at the first three factors that we are now of 1.1 billion in may 13 billion tons of communications and enough just did n't look !
see that we so the fourth factor of -- and this is a to be -- this is the amount of co2 per will .
it turns out of the question , if you look at zero got to be .
if coal burning , `` no .
if you gas burning , `` no .
almost every for power today co2 , except for renewables renewables and .
well , what we on a global level to do need , is a new system to do .
we need .
if i now the term `` wonders favorite feature , my i 'm not impossible .
the is a miracle of the airline 's a miracle .
the internet and whose services is a miracle .
the people here we have to the development synthesis of this miracle contributed .
normally , there are n't be a miracle to this to a particular date needs .
typically trial by touching just missed at some come to others not .
in case we have we do n't give up a miracle in very short time poll .
now , i asked me , how can i really ?
there is a natural , a demonstration , the idea of people here passion ?
i was reminded me last year , when i mosquitos took and somehow liked , people .
the idea was for you really inspiration , you know that people there , with mosquitos life .
for energy struck me show a .
i decided that , of fireflies my main contribution to your environment over here , to dignity .
here are so some natural fireflies .
you have my alliance , that they do n't bite . in fact , they 're probably not let 's a glass leave .
now , there are all sorts of like this , but they bring all not much .
we need solutions , either a sort of tens of a wetland scaling of unimaginable strength and although it 's unpredictable directions : there , in those people after supposed to see i really only five , these large demands afford life-saving .
i , fusion and biofuels left .
these germans maybe a piece and if you better afford when i expect to be great , but my punch here is that we at all of heroic , five work correctly , and we ca n't of you quit , because they us , because all have problems .
look we first is the burning fossil fuels along the burning of either of coal or gas .
what you where do have it seems to maybe just , but here 's not you ought to all the co2 , after the burning from the next piece , under pressure and then somewhere in storage and hope that there remains .
there are some , on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level to do , but it on 100 percent to get treated very difficult to be and an agreement for the storage of co2 to destroy that 's a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the .
who will be sure ?
who can make something guarantee , which literally a lot billion times bigger than any kind of garbage , to find out of and other things think anybody ?
this is a lot volume .
so this is a very hard .
when next question .
that has also three big problems . the cost , especially interested in countries are high the question after security to be really feel that nothing wrong to go to be , despite the human participation , that the fuel not for weapons used by .
and what makes you get to the garbage ?
well , though he 's not very large , there is a lot consider .
so three very difficult problems , maybe soluble are , and places where you must work should .
the last three of five i was summed up .
it 's renewables renewables , how often called be .
and also have -- although it 's awesome is that they any fuel needs -- they have some downsides .
for a , these technologies create dramatic lower than the .
that 's , you talk about many of the gate unit area as a normal station .
also reversal of these vents . ''
the sun shining not the whole day , it seems sometimes not every day and as blows also the wind not continuously .
why have you , if you of these vents depending on a way , have the energy vibrating in time when you do n't available to get .
there are here so big there are challenges in the transmission . if we self-assemble say that the source outside of the country 1 , you need not just the technology , you need also with the risk interact that the energy from where different heritage .
and there .
and to dimension to show , i 'm sure all kinds of us batteries , the recycling technologies , brown : for car , the computer , phones , , for everything and i was with the amount of electronic energy , what 's the planet uses , compared i found out that all the batteries , we now makers , less than 10 minutes of storage could .
we need to show so a big seller said , something that make a factor 100 better be used as the present time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
this happens when you try to make a hint about saying we 20 percent -- 30 percent of to bring .
when you about 100 percent obesity sustain want to need an incredible .
now , where should we go `` what is the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project called ? how come we signal goal ?
what we need are many companies to talk about working with hundreds of .
in any kind of these five neurologic function , we least 100 people .
in many they 're saying : are crazy ! this is good .
i think , here in the ted group , there are many people out there already engaged .
bill army has multiple companies , under else 's called the great weekend .
invest in dozens companies are great things done and interesting ways we and i try to support .
nathan and i fund another company that may surprise , the nuclear approach her .
there are some innovations in advance of liquid .
the progress has in this industry particularly some time stopped , so it 's no big surprise that some good concepts .
that means that you instead of one of hub of , which one percent of , we decided to the 99 percent to burn , .
this is quite a crazy idea .
but actually did you about before long syria , but you could never rational simulate , whether it work would , but since it modern supercomputer there , you could it to simulate and see that : yeah ! with the right to see it looks like that it .
and because you that 99 percent of calories that 's very much better .
actually burning , you the garbage , and you can actually lay waste of today reactors like to use .
instead , about the head to crush them , burn it just a great thing .
uranium fuel energy consumed a little bit like a grateful .
you see that 's kind column , often than `` wave reactor `` bossy .
that solve really .
here 's a picture , one pakistan , in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent of you have the piece of today is appropriately described , so it 's called uranium .
the u.s. for hundreds of years on .
and if you 're inexpensive and just get you enough fuel for the expo lifetime of the planet .
you know , there are sitting still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to forward to come .
think we , how we our success of measuring should .
how should our testament to look ?
now , go we except derartu goal , we reach need and then talking about ourselves over the .
many discussions of an 80 percent reduction until 2050 .
it 's really very important that we donâ€™t get .
the rest 20 percent are going to poor countries creates be replaced still something that agriculture . hopefully gets and cement far back clean bombs .
so , to these 80 percent to achieve that have developed , including countries like china , their completely forbid .
the ninth grade , say , whether we are technology advocating , if you in all developed countries deployed and we on the way they 're going to the rest to get .
this is super important .
that 's a picture .
if we go from there on trails , how should 2020 testament to look ?
it should restore the two elements contain .
we should use to reduction in the way to bring more gave us , less fat will be , and so even the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we thrive not completely to the major rivers , just firing , or even slightly less important as the other , which are astonished the innovation to make breakthroughs displays .
make breakthroughs need to us to track and we can measure , in , in and .
there are many great books to this topic .
al gore book `` we have the choice '' and david , `` sex corn air . ''
they go there really through and create a framework , in which this broad novels used to be , because we need for support of all sides .
there 's hygiene , fuse have .
this is a desire .
a rather wish that we this technology invent .
if you to me just a desire for the next 50 years , i could the president to choose a , and love me , or i could this desire to pick up the question , no carbon being invented this desire feared myself .
this has the biggest impact .
if we this desire does n't work , it the wind from long-term , and the term josh people are terrible link between states and china , between poor and rich countries and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse , to .
what we have we so i do ?
for which punish myself ?
we need to us for more productive .
if countries fall in places like decision-making , should not just about carbon to speak .
they should those in rotterdam , and they would shocked by the ridiculous low , for that cutting-edge spent mainly .
we need carbon taxes , & amp trade something that a reference .
we need to the news spread .
we need dialogue , and chromosomes lead and also the things that of the government something will .
it 's an important desire , but i think , we find him fill .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you just to something better to understand -- the bloodstream , you can organize an idea of scale this investment to give you ?
bill gates : to the simulation on a supercomputer reforms , all the great scientist to get , what we did we need we just some 10 million and even if we our materials in a russian reactor delhi used to make sure that it rational works , you just in the million .
the problem step is build the first , further billion people to find the and the place in fact , the first hear dylan .
once the first done is , if it 's the size running as i promised , then everything is quite clear , because the , which is so different than at , as we know it .
to the right to understand : it means deeply into the ground to build almost like a vertical pillar nuclear , this glucose and then begin to the process up and slow moving forward for the bottom ?
bg : right now have the reactor ever to , so there are many people and lots of the wrong to go to get thing , where you do it opens and stuff , or this is not good !
if you but very cheap fuel has , you could hold for 60 years -- thinking about a column -- buried , without the whole .
and it sits there and it burns 60 years long and then it 's done .
a , even a solution for the garbage offering .
bg : yeah . now , what to the garbage happens : you can him sitting aside -- there are much less junk with this method -- then take him and grab him in the next reactor and burning more .
and we start by we lay waste take the already exists in these or at the reactor is that 's our .
so , what causes these reactors a problem was , what we in our toes and so that 's going to dramatically reduce during this process .
but as you with different people this world over these options talked very much .
where it 's largest interest , so what actually implement ?
bg : now we have us still not on a place zoning and there 's a lot more interesting for everything ! '' in called serotonin and there 's big interest and the people of the company that were in russia , india , china -- i was here and i got the decisions and about bullshit , like this to fit .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the way done .
this is a flavor from one thing that did was .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have these puppets , why is everybody in a rapid reactor implemented , which has a for our first .
in their imagination , and the probability as something really launched live to randi ?
bg : now we need one of these things , the very affordable cost , we have 20 years to innovate and then 20 years to advocate .
this is touching the most competitive levers have seen that we need .
and you know , , if anything good racing , and this is a great wish that could be easy cash .
and fortunately , there are now , dozens of companies , and we needed hundreds of the , as if their approaches worked on the funding for its operator worked for can .
and it would be at best , if there are several do , because then you could find a mixture use .
on every case need that we have a solution .
polls a major types breakthroughs , this is the biggest , you know ?
bg : a .
if it even without the 1920s , but that makes it still so much more important .
in a nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we know whose work not as well as this , but there are method is a neuroscientist approach .
there is a , which bit difficult it seems , but what might say about us .
and so there is different , but this lovely talk about is that a a million times as much energy has like a to say , we have a and therefore , if you with the problems interact can and these are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on land and other things , almost in one of your own .
if it 's not works , what happened ?
we have we have to try to the robust to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation that came , it 's as if you too much eating one , and before a attack represents what makes you get ? you need maybe a or lesser death .
there is a very distinctive calls himself with various techniques serene , to the warming to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer moisture around us .
this is just a .
you pray that we do n't need .
some people say , you should absolutely not only on the insurance industries because one might lazy you know , aromatase , you keep eat , because you know that belongs to save oil .
i do n't know , whether or smart , if you look at the importance of this problem scared eyes lead , but there are now a discourse in addition , if you to provide we should , if the things rapidly go , or those innovation longer need , when we expect .
: they have a or two sentences for the around you may have to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately live in the skeptics in very different .
who , the scientific arguments do that are very low .
they say that 's negative effects there , with the clouds to do have to the things that upsetting ?
there 's very , very few things that you ever say to get from where it 's a chance in a million there .
here is so similar as diet aids .
you make the mistake , now , and you pays for much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all sorts of problems has come into something to invest in from you only later what does -- and methane gets that the investment not so clearly is actually is the summary minority not necessarily the worst scenario and there are people in the rich world , you the summary look and say , okay , this is not a big , drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty we care to make should .
but my dream this is that , if you are ecological communities that can , and the same carbon cleaned , then say also the skeptics , `` okay , it 's interests me not sure that 's no carbon , i wish asia , that it 's unfair , but i 'm comfortable accept , because it cheaper than the previous method . ''
and if your answer this argument that , if you all this time and energy uses this co2 problem to solve all the other goals underneath pain , the , the proper of malaria and so forth , that it 's just waste of resources , money for to invest , as it better stuff there , we can do .
bg : well , the actual expenses for the research -- say we the u.s. satellites 10 billion per year than spend when you today do -- this is not so dramatically .
underneath should other things not suffer .
you come going to major , and here could have sensible and people disagree that if you something that does n't be economically , and trying to fund for me happening here the most of waste .
it be well , you very before a and financed just before i think we need more things trying to the potential , have much cheaper to be .
if the , the you get a very high , then you can only the rich doug .
i mean , each of us here could be five times as much for our energy spend without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion but it 's a disaster .
and even thinking about .
his new is now , `` why does the research has no longer narratives ? ''
he 's still , because its former stories , with associated , but he has understood that , a very lonely group and so get it now .
and this is a , the i was considered appropriate movement .
the research , it 's just nuts , like ann who supported by .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i hope actually , that your desire true going to many , thanks .
bg : thank you .
several years ago , here at ted williams peter a called `` the '' ago .
the idea is pretty easily have the very brute structure with 20 pounds of tape , about silk thread and a marshmallow build .
the marshmallow got up strap bombs .
and , although it really just seems that 's actually really hard , because people pushing very quickly cooperate .
and so i was that this is an interesting idea is and i 'm in a landscape .
it was a huge success .
since i was about 70 workshops world conducted with students , and architects , even with the and there 's something about this task , what microbes impressions , in the nature of collaboration possible and i want some of them with you share .
watson start the most people themselves terms of task to orient .
they 're talking about , you think about how to look going to make .
then to invest a little time in planning and organization and lay out .
they invest a lot of their time in the sort translates structures .
and finally , shortly before they are no time anymore have to take someone the marshmallow and they put him gently down the top , step one step back and `` oh ! admire their work .
what but then , almost always happens is that , `` '' to a `` '' becomes , because the weight of environmental outreach that the whole thing out dancing and .
there is a series of people who are more ! '' i 've got another , and under the worst 's fresh .
you lie , they cheat , they are confused and produce a really alike .
and of course , there are liberal team of the more ! '' have and under the best 's fresh alumni of .
and this is pretty amazing .
how to let peter on producing them not just the highest towers , but also the hippocampus structures of all .
what you might ask you will is : how come ? why ? what is with whom ?
and peter told , `` none of children invest time good employee is the to be ''
they invest no time in .
there but still a donation reason .
and although that trained were the plan right plan to find , ok !
and it going to realize .
what if happens when you the marshmallow on the top package , you have no time more and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what else do is that they with the marshmallow beginning and prototypes build a successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they repeatedly : the ability to have prototypes to repair .
see this kind of collaboration as a core , one .
and with each trial get the kids immediate feedback what works and what does n't .
so the performance , using prototypes to work , regulation ; but see ourselves again , how different teams act .
the average for the most leadership at about to create the latter part of lawyers make something more , but not a lot of are better than adults .
who 's most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
chimborazo , what i 've seen mentioned .
and why ? because triangles understand and geometric patterns are the key to ski structures to build .
ceos wrong about average . but here it 's interesting .
assuming you a on the team , they 're dramatically better .
it 's incredible . you see moving around and see `` this team going to win . ''
you can predict why is that ?
because they particular skills so much .
they power the process , you understand him .
and the balconies team , regulate and on the work becomes the performance of teams dramatically improving .
skills and and their combination lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have to the typical proceed to get you about six , stable structures made .
i tried now a little electrons .
i thought to bring us the same .
so drastically , i was a dollar prize on software for the winner .
what we believe it happen with this ?
what was the result ?
this happen , not a team had a stable structure .
if you tennis , a high construction built , you know , you know it 's the price went home wore it .
so not interesting , that node a strong effect have ?
we repeated this exercise with 1.8 students .
what we believe it happen now ?
well understood the advantage of `` ''
it was like a household , bad team , one amongst the best .
they produced the highest construction in the races of time .
there are so the lessons for us about the nature of incentive and success .
you may wonder : why would somebody actually were investing a to create ?
the reason is , i digital tools and processes make the sporting team to help the car , games , `` '' to make .
and what does is , it helps you a hidden assumptions about to identify .
well , frankly said , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language georges , the right prototype to build .
and this is the value of this experience , this is how simple practice .
and by a of you 're interested in order to visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to build .
there is a place .
you find a crazy examples from all the world , how people that system stats and .
there 's also .
and the lesson , i think is this embodiment actually a sports .
it requires that we all our senses at the task telescope and that we our thinking optimal use , as our feelings and our do , in the challenge protecting us is .
and sometimes is a small prototype this experience anything , what it takes us from a `` '' -- to a word `` jacques to bring .
and that can a big difference do .
thank you .
do we so when i would we see a machine .
a big machine , a cool , machine , and this is a machine .
and everybody in this room must go .
and you can in the past go , you can go into the future go ; they can not in here and now permanently .
and i 'm wondering what you vote would , because i my friends in a minute time often those questions asked myself , and they wanted everybody in the past go .
i do n't know they wanted in the time back before it cars were or twitter or `` america seeking the idol ''
i do n't know .
i am convinced that you kind ultimate revenge to dates .
and understand myself .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want in the past , and it 's not , because i was a americas ;
it is to talk about that options on planet not back to go , you go forward .
i want to which is this machine , and i want to go into the future demographic .
this is the magnificent era , depending on planet there were no matter particles scale ; co : health , affluence and mobility , opportunities are declining .
there were never before a time as this .
my died all than 60 penguins .
my grandparents pressing this number on 70 .
my parents are able to 80 on the .
there should so better a nine on to start my tracks .
but it wo n't try to people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a child , today in delhi born it might expect , so long to live as the richest man on the world up a hundred years .
think of this is an amazing fact .
and why is why ?
the smallpox eradicated smallpox have a billion people on planet killed .
they have the demographics of the planet on a way to shaped , how do n't have a war ever managed weight .
they are the way they 're gone .
we have oxide .
in the rich world exists disease , the millions of us up just one generation terror threat we 're barely left .
, ...
know existed before anyone , which is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , that are simulating the scientific method .
and from my view is the scientific method of things to try to look , whether it works differently , if it 's not sorry , a vegetable achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately has been the whole good news , because there is a few other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one illustration is that despite all our achievements a billion people on this world every day hungry people to bed to go .
this number drops , and rising very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and not just , we have our imagination lead used to this world forgotten to trash .
drinking water , the country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and although soon , and if we do n't look at this chaos of disappearing , we also .
the question is so , `` can do this ? i think before .
i think it 's clear that we feed produce babies , the billion people feed it , without the country , on your life , to .
i think , we can this world with power renewables , you 're not the same destroyed .
i believe that really , and no , this is not a .
but here keeps me night awake -- one of the things that i night awake barbaria we have science progress has never so desperately replaced anyway , now , we 've never .
and we were also never in the able to treat rational , as we do today can .
we 're at the door to amazing , amazing events on many areas and yet i think i really , that we have hundreds of 300 years ago , the enlightenment back to go economists make a time to find in the measure progress territory have in the world are about these things have to participate more non-zero-sumness , as a moment .
people membrane around in their beliefs , and fuzzy as closely , that you 're not free to be .
ca n't even the truth is going free .
and listen to everybody has a right on his argument implicit in fact an extraordinarily on his argument for progress .
but you know , inspiring she did n't quite common ?
they did n't quite on their own facts , they have n't .
and i 'm a while ringing , to find out .
before about a decade i was an article about vaccination for `` sex new boss wrote a little paper .
and i was amazed at to bump up resistance towards mars , which ended up effective penetration in health in history of humanity .
i knew did n't know what i do should be so i did i just what i always desperation , i wrote an article and drove forth .
and the ladder waiting emailed me an article about atmospheric food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people playing crazy .
so i 've also about an article written , and i could n't understand why people thought , that would say `` why they believed that molecules on a certain instead of a random kind of a on this area of nature was .
but you know , i sometime what i sometime i wrote the articles , i made more .
i mean , i am a journalist ,
we tap , we 're rich guy , we go to eat , that 's okay .
but these articles made me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and finally found myself out .
and this is to talk about that these , i really made at n't do n't been .
they were people , educated people , a decent people .
they were exactly how people in this room .
and gave me that disturbing --
but then i was , you know what to reinvent ourselves financially ?
we 're at a point boom , at which we 're not the same proportion to progress very much discussed earlier .
we 're talking about them .
we 're talking ironic them , with a small issue , `` advance ''
okay , for there are reasons , and i think we know , some reasons that are .
we have faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science closer look lost , and there 's no reason why do n't like to be rude .
you can just a few pies call and people will understand .
chernobyl , the , destruction , the 2000 .
i mean , you know , you get your own lists vote .
there are questions and problems with the people from where we believed that they still quite would be careful you so skeptical .
ask questions that urge you have evidence that urge you parliament .
take you do n't be given a while .
but now comes anderson : if you have evidence got ta watch this evidence take , and terrorists are we 're not good .
and i can from the reason to say that we now in an epidemic of fear life , as i 've never seen mentioned , and hopefully never been seen going .
before about 12 years has been a story posted a horrific tale of the with , and in the association gave them .
very .
folder studies were conducted to see , whether this proposition .
folder participants must campus will advance this is a serious issue .
the data came nepal .
the data came egos out the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all alike , no , no link , absolutely no .
it makes any difference . it makes any difference , because we of a guru who believe that we think , what we see what we have to see think whatâ€™s causing , that we real feel .
we think it 's not at a neurologic documents from one of us data , there , and i understand , i think , do we all .
but you know what ?
the result of them was .
because this fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries on the world , in which the for jacket .
this is and we should we ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happens to do this could .
now , i understand this desperation , i .
well , has to show anybody ?
has a manufacturer in the audience ever someone start to die see ?
happens is not very often .
happens in this country 's not at , but hang on the world in the last year .
that are many deaths due to 20 per hour .
but because it 's not this happens is , we can displace them , and people like how swarms of messages of fear and illiteracy platforms like , nancy and larry king live .
and you can do , because they cause and not connecting .
they understand not sure that these things that moment to be far-fetched , but almost never the same data .
and this is something that we learn to have , and although it 's very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas .
he us from one of the worst of humanity .
no fear , no , oxide , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
it means that paul .
he has just with a few other people a built .
he can live by to 700,000 children per year in the developing save .
pretty good , right ?
now , that 's good chess pieces that paul and through vaccines talk , and says , how valuable they are , and that people just stop ought to complain .
and says he actually much .
paul 's so a .
if paul in a public talk about how he did n't no armed guardian statements .
he gets calls home , because people to him like to talk , that you know where his kids to school go .
and why ? because paul farmer did anybody .
i need n't say , but that vaccines are essential .
take you 're continuing to return the disease back to terrible disease , and that happens right .
we have in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon be children back to talk about dying because that 's just a question of the numbers .
and they 're not just started to die .
what is with ? take us why not ?
one of mine sent me up a few weeks wrote and told you believe i 'm a little too .
nobody has ever said .
they would get child 's not against vaccinated in any case .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't have and you know what ?
we had in this country night quarters .
now , i do n't know , maybe joined morning guy in lagos at a plane and fly straight for the los angeles , in the moment is it 's about ohio .
and in a few hours lands ends up a car , and he comes after the beach beach , and he 's one of this today night visit .
and he would n't know that it with a disease parasite is , and we know that 's also not , because it works the world now time .
this is the planet , on our lives . do n't like to consider whether it 's not .
we love to us in a lie to pork ; we love .
they have this morning everybody their vitamins taken ?
, a little , you , in leaps helps .
i know that they did have , because half of americans every day you know .
you take this stuff , and you take alternative cure , and it makes any difference , how often we find that you 're useless are .
the data , verify that constantly .
it absorbs their urine . more do you almost never .
that 's okay , you want like ancestral billion dollars for the dark urine numbers .
i voice you a completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do ? why do we do ?
now , i think , i understand -- we hate the industry .
we hate , too strong government . we did n't trust prison system .
and should we also not our health is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and even to us , it does contribute to get .
we walk so before way , and where walks us ?
we walk into the poor .
this is terrific . i love the .
but you know , that 's really a very serious issue because that stuff is crap , and we give billion dollars for reasons .
and i 'm all sorts of a small prop up .
naked them -- cheated , , cheating , , actually know i do n't time , which is , but we 're going billion dollars profit from cheating .
and you know what ? when i say , screaming me , people on and say `` what cares about yourself ? let people yet done , what you want .
so they feel perfectly good . ''
and you know what ? you 've been wrong .
because it to me anyway , whether it 's say , `` hmm , i 'm the parliament in my experts getting mammograms are not take '' or a forger , of his patients with treating want .
when you on this road entering , where think , and the magic parliament and science replace , get them on a place , places where they do n't be altruism .
you get to in south .
he gave 400,000 its people around , because he would be careful examination , that red , and more effective than a life-saving drugs are , from where we know that they last democrat from aids brakes to get .
hundreds of death in a country , worse than any other kinds of this disease will .
they say , i ask not sure that these things are n't consequences have .
they have lost forever .
now , the epidemic in the we currently receiving those absurd struggle between food and the .
this is a debate has to stop .
it 's a debate about words about metaphors .
this ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every , each branch , everyone was from the people changed .
you know , there is no in paradise .
there were no .
there were n't we 've all done .
we have in the last eleven years done .
and improvements them has worked and improvements n't .
we 're rid of what do n't work done .
now we can influence to make of course there risks . but we can make something like vitamin c , where rice do , and this stuff can million people to help millions of people , your life to do .
you want to do n't do ?
i must say to understand that i 'm not .
we refuse changed food off .
why do we do ?
now , what i always listening is : too many of chemicals that pesticides , hormones , , we want to do n't be huge fields with one thing that 's wrong .
we want to do n't know that companies alive .
we want to do n't know that companies seeds have .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , you have quite repair ourselves .
it 's true , we have a huge , but this is not science .
this has to science , nothing to do .
it 's right , morality .
you know that the science is no company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes work , he and sometimes not , but the idea that we the science not allow should be their work to do , because we 're afraid you have a real dead , and she stops millions of people from the flu away .
you know , in the next 50 years will we 're 70 percent more food crops need to be in the moment -- 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need , and we give you ca n't .
and why ? changed food .
we want people would n't really encouraging this stuff to eat , like for example .
is something that 's a half billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a neurologic calories . it 's miserable .
it does require nutrients , it does n't have protein , and scientists building all right inside a .
and then we might , people eat and you would n't blind be .
they would n't starvation , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful it would n't , but it would be beautiful .
and everything , what i tend to say ca : why fight us ?
i mean , questions we : why fight us ?
because we 're not genes want ?
it wo n't worry about genes . it wo n't use chemicals .
it wo n't use our ridiculous passion for hormones , our on the mastery food , better food , food .
it comes up not using connexions , it comes product , people on to live to get out , and it becomes the highest incarceration , to understand , which means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do , if we so on wondering how far do we of a little bit guilty , at which we , i think , not guilty , to want , high-tech colonialism .
there any other description for what this happens .
it 's a selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we 've got really egg .
after this incredible funny entertainment you want so might say `` want you still in this ridiculous hal and in the future demographic ? ''
on every case that wants me on every case .
in the leaves behind them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can this machine on all imagine what we want .
we can see , where we want , and we 're touching move , where we want .
we 've got these conversations lead , and we need to think , but if we in the machine rise and in the future go to be we 're happy to be done to have .
i know that we can , and far 'm concerned , is something , what the world now needs .
thank you .
thank you .
since the heroes were interested i 'm to it may strange follow that has a magician for interest to be well , you look like me , as `` a deception , to some laughs that will , if someone just determined enough to talk about whatever . ''
with anybody who have in some trials a professor yochai showed up the , and strap just jump , because the person thinking , what to get herself to be a or a kind of -- in , for example , there , if the patient eyes tightly enough to talk about whatever , a effect in the body , you the calls .
a deception is going to some laughs , because somebody like that sees .
so we each other understand , i 'd give you now a , quite simple trick show .
and i 'll give you show how he runs this is a trick at least since the 1950s , in any for kids standing .
i even photographed him from the magic of in the 1970s learned .
i 'm hoping for politics and he 'll explain .
and then i 'll explain why i asked him explain .
so , you see what happens .
that knife , they 're looking can ; my hand , they 're looking can .
i 'm knife just like in my francisco hold .
i my sleeve back .
and make sure that nothing in my sleeve mars or from his newest , i 'll just my vinci right here .
on this way you can see that has to none of time anything moved long as i show you ca n't in my sleeve angeles or coming out .
and this objective reality is quite easily .
i 'm going to my hands , open , and hopefully , if anything good about , it 's a knife by my bare physical , rip .
it sits actually like holding on its place that i shake can , without that knife .
nothing labyrinth in my sleeve , or come out , no and you can all looking .
!
now , that 's a trick , the i often little kid , look for magic interested , because you can help very much about deception learn , if you look closely separation , although it 's a very simple trick is .
probably know a lot of you here in the room this trick .
he runs market-based ,
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i my vinci , to ensure that nothing in my sleeve mars or the squid , and this is a lie .
the reason why i my vinci , is that inside the actual secret of illusion made .
in the moment -- namely , where i mean by hand of them , so you go from behind see , moving into this one finger here , my , just from there , where he was in a position , in the beetle dances .
franz trick ?
there behind blank page , no kid had .
so , he sits down here . yeah .
and when i 'm going to change the finger its position .
and now could you about transformation , why is a deception is why you ca n't really convinced that here , down just three fingers to see : it 's because the minds and the way , as official information processing , they do individually count , one , two , three , rather than a group see .
but why is now this really absolutely not to go zip i mean by hand .
obviously it 's going to southern hemisphere , but not by the of my body , but through a trick , by myself , now there is .
and when i mean seat belts , what happens same reaction i 'm going through this movement hidden , that the finger at once .
i suppose that hand away and here is that knife .
this trick to get your friends and neighbor demonstrate . thank you .
now , what has to the to do ?
imagine a year or so , read me a study that i really right blew me .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and why was for me an amazing thing .
it has changed hollywood sign bust : if you a in form a white pills offer in the form a , is just a round , white pills , a particular measurable effect weight .
but if you the form , in the hydrogen sulfide , for example in a smaller ball , change , and these blue and write letters waiting , is actually measurable effective .
and , although not stopping heaven ... there are merely .
but a white pills is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that blew me really freak .
it turns out , but he found that still not everything is .
if you take that are more effective than pills every form .
a colored capsule on an end yellow and at another red is that 's better than a white capsule .
but the plays a role .
a ball twice day is not as well as three pills -- i can me now not at the exact statistics remember doing 'm sorry .
this critical but ...
-- that 's also a role play .
and the form of play a role .
and if you the ultimate we want to have you to pin reach .
right ? an injection with a -- couple of a substance , you a patient .
that creates a very strong image in mind that 's very much stronger as a white pills .
this graph is really -- i 'll give a different times show , if we a very much .
the fact so that the white pills are not as well , acts like the blue pill , not as well , acts like a capsule , not as well , acts like the needle .
and no running has modified it really the attribute it 's just our believe in us a stronger effect successes .
i wanted to know , if i idea for a trick use abstractions .
i suppose some , obviously a deception is , and cockroaches , it 's cool to look .
we know what am from philadelphia study that you to pin reach have , if it rational thing to go ?
this is an 18 inch long it 's very , very and i 'll notice first a little bit .
here 's really my ham 's not a special meat .
here 's my skin is not from hollywood .
i 'm now , this needle in my skin diplomacy and through dust push , until you on the other side again .
if you evil by -- if you can easily in the fall -- i have a few friends last night in the hotel chicago , and some people that i never knew , and about is a woman almost faint gotten .
i propose so imagine if you very quickly culprit is going to get a look for the next 30 seconds away , or you know what i 'm the first part up behind do .
you can appear to see , you ca n't even if you want .
so , it goes like , right here , where my ham starts at the lower part of my i 'll just a little boys .
sorry for me assure sorry to make you really ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side way back out .
now we are actually in the same condition , we 're watching had .
about .
but now you can my fingers do n't count ?
so , i 'll give you show that is one , two , three , four , five .
now , yes ,
i know what people think , if you see .
they say `` okay , which is certainly not so stupid and itself the skin , just to us a few minutes long to offline . ''
now , then i 'll give you show .
how to see here from ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people behind say `` okay . i do n't really seen . ''
people in the come now all .
let me tell from the near show .
this is really my skin is not from hollywood .
this is my ham , and i can .
does 'm sorry if you culprit is going to look away , let 's not a while .
people behind or later eventually some point on video to see that will say , `` well yeah , that looks maybe fairly impressive out , but if it cool would expect it -- you see here 's a hole and there , if it really cool would expect it . ''
okay , let me a low blood for them .
yes , here is it .
normally would i now the needle toes .
i would my arm drinking and you show that there are n't lesions are .
but i think , in this palette again and with intent , from a deception some laughs to do , i 'm going to the needle just because sometime let and so by the stage to go .
we 're moving into the next days before a few times meet .
i hope that library has been waiting . thanks .
every talk today about happiness .
i have some people the number of books counting let 's titled `` '' in the crown in the last five years , releasing 8,000 , and they gave up about 40 square , and there were even more .
there is a massive wave of on happiness beneath the explorers .
there 's very much .
everybody would like , people happier do .
but despite all spot tide of work , there are several cognitive fall , the kind of almost impossible to make sure about happiness thinking .
and my talk today 's mostly of these cognitive fall into action .
true for about your own happiness think , and it 's true for scientists , about happiness think , because they well , that we just like this mess that are like everyone else .
the first of these fall is a , complexity acknowledge .
it turns itself out that word happiness just not a useful word more importantly , because we respond to many different things unconsciously .
i think , there is a particular meaning , on the we shrink could , but in large and all is something that we abandon you will need , and we 're the complicated view take need to focus , what well-being .
the second case is a of experience and memory , in basically made from happy to be in his life and happy to be about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both in the idea from happiness .
and the third is the , and this is the fact that we 're not about a closet to think understanding of well-being affected , without its importance to curve .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there is simply no way , it really tries to get .
now would i love with an example start by anyone who 's been looking at a my lectures , a story of hurricane . [ unclear that -- [ he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely splendid music , and very end of the conductor there was a sound .
and then you added , he added , really quite emotionally , has the whole experience of ruins .
but did n't it .
what it ruined had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience of hype .
he had 20 minutes of music had .
they do n't , because it with a memory was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all , what he to keep getting burned .
what we really does is that we about ourselves and over the other people think elephants in the sense of two types of self .
there is an even in the present lives and the present know , can be the past it back to experience , but in basically just the presence has .
it 's true self , the doctor -- you know , if the doctor ask , `` does it now hurts when i see here ? ''
and then there is a itself , and itself is , and the story of our life to maintain hits , and it 's the tires , the doctor , using it 's the question arises : `` how they have turned into final time felt ? ''
or `` what was their journey up albania ? '' or so similar .
these are two very different entities , themselves and itself , and the two to confuse is part of from happiness .
now , itself is a storyteller .
and starts really with a basic reaction in our memories involved -- it begins immediately started .
we talk not just stories , if we talk about making the stories to talk .
our memory told us stories , which means , what we of our disney keep allowed is a story .
and let them with an example start .
there is an old study .
that 's real patients who has a painful procedure rigorous data .
i 'm not into detail go nowadays , no more painful , but she was painful than this study at the 1990s experiments done .
they were asked , all of 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients are your records .
and they 're asking `` who by both have more suffered ? ''
and this is a very simple question .
the patient b has explicit more suffered . he was married , and every minute of pain patient a boyfriend had the patient b , and more .
but now there is a different question : `` how much thought these patients that they infections ? ''
and here 's a surprise :
and the surprise is that patient cala a lot of the had as the patient b .
the stories of been divergent , and because a very clue part of the story is how it ends )
and none of these stories is very or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is substantially worse than the other .
and the worse is that was , where the pain disappeared in the end up its peak was it 's a dirty story .
where know what we do ?
because we these people knock your asked people , and too much later , `` how bad was the whole thing about caves ? ''
and she was much worse for a threat to b in the .
now , that 's a direct conflict between ourselves and the itself .
from view of self was diagnosed clearly a time .
now , what you with the patient a scientist could , and we 've actually clinical experiments experiments , and it 's made met , and it works , you could actually of the patient a do by you just the nightmare inside out without getting very close to him to .
this will cause gridlock , that the patient suffering , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you a few minutes long power did whatâ€™s causing that , even by the patient a bad closer and you have outreach that , even by the patient a lot better goliath is , because now has given the patient cala a better story about his experience given .
rendering draws on a story from ?
and that 's true for the stories , exercising our designs and it 's true both for the stories that we invent .
clustering into a story are big moments , and the end .
end are very , very important and in case of the end .
now , even live his life , ambiguous .
it has moments of , one after another .
and you ask : what happens with those moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they 're for forever lost .
i mean , the most enjoyable part life -- and i 'm the hallway one -- you know , the psychological present younger than about three seconds long , which means , you know , that it in a life about 600 million them there in a month , there are 100,000 displaced the most of you leave no embarrassment .
the most of you 're completely ignored , from itself .
and yet gotten to sort of the impression that they count should know what during those moments of happens our lives .
it 's limited resource , we consume as we on this world are .
and how we consume it would seem important to be , but this is not the story , even for us crescent .
so we ourselves and itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the time interacting with time .
from view of self , if you a holiday spent and the second week exactly as well as the first , then is the vacation twice as well as the vacation .
it works is not at for themselves .
for itself is a vacation hardly be better than the holidays because there are no new memories 'd be .
they have the story is n't changed .
and on this way back really critical variable that a itself logically consistent with our own time has very little impact on the story .
now , even make more than to remember , and stories to talk .
it 's actually gamble makes decisions true , because if you put patients have been able to tell us two things about two different surgeons had and they decide , whatever he would choose should , then , the votes in the memory , which has less bad and that is the surgeon , selected will happen .
even has no voice in particular choice .
actually choose we 're not from disney . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we at the future thinking , think we started our future usually not as experiences .
we think about our future for the collective memories .
and in basically you can look , you know , as a traditionally , of self , and you can imagine that even sooner than one of this kind of myself through experience , even do n't need .
i 've got the impression that if we vacation do this very often the case , which means that we do a vacation largely on services of itself .
and this is a little hard to justify to think i .
i mean , how much we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations for the dominance of even gave it .
and when i about what nathan went to think i started a vacation at the world are a few years ago , in antarctica did you 've identified the best vacation trip , the i ever had been , and i think this fairly often lacking in proportion tend to how often i believe others think .
and i 'm probably from my memory of this journey , i would say about 25 minutes long in the last four years .
now , when i ever the folder curl would take over 600 slides seamlessly wish i had a more hour spent .
now , that are three weeks , and this data tag half hours .
there seems a to be .
now , i like a little extreme to be , you know , honey , how little appetite , i 'm proud of memories i , but even if you more accessible to do there is a real question is why give our memories so much weight in to the weight , we disney be ?
so i 'd think about an experiment to think .
ask them into their next twenty years , you know that the end of all their pictures vivid playground , and they get a drug , so that you look at n't remember being .
now , if you the same vacation pick ?
and if you another one eyebrow vote would , there is a conflict between your two types of self and they need to think about how this conflict decide , and this is really not at obviously , because if you in the sense of time thinking get an answer , and if you in the sense of memories reasoning could take a different solution deployed .
why we choose , we choose a problem , around us question with a choice between two types of self .
now , the two types of our own throw two contested , from fortune on .
there are actually two concepts , from happiness , we use to get emails per itself .
you can so the question : how happy , is itself ?
and then you would you ask : how happy are moments in life of itself ?
and they 're all -- luckily for those moments is a fairly complicated process .
which are the emotions , which correlations are able to do ?
and , incidentally , we 're now seeds become a pretty good idea to get from fortune of ourselves over the time .
if you after the celebrities of yourself questions is a whole other thing .
that 's not ours , as happy one person to live .
it 's convinced , as happy or pleased to the person is , if this person about your life antarctica .
very different conception .
each of those phrases n't distinguish going to explore the happiness muck and i belong to a lot of researchers about comfort , exploration of happiness long have on exactly this way .
the distinction between happiness project ourselves and the goodness of self is in the last years recognized met , and now effort you look at the two to measure .
the have a global survey , in the more than a half million people ask questions met these are about what you about your life thinking and over their experiences and there were other efforts in the way .
in the last years we 've so i started thinking about happiness the two types of myself to learn .
and the lesson that we think i have learned is that they really chimps are .
you can understand how happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about how happy patch , to live lives and backwards .
just to give a glimpse of the to convey the is about .
which means is that if someone meet you would and you would tell , oh , and his father 's a , how much would you about its size know ?
now , they would have about its size know , but there are much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i 'm saying that someone his life than eight at a scale of 10 did they have much uncertainty about how happy chord with its own .
so low .
we know something about what happiness , of imagery .
we know that money very important goals are very important .
we know that happiness mainly mean , happy to be with people that we may have time to spend with people that we may .
there are other joy , but this is imperative .
if you so lucky the two types of myself to maximize want to be the end very different things do .
the conclusion from what i 'm here said i is that we knock it really do n't think should be a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely other memes .
now , very quickly , some other reason , out that we 're not clear about happiness think we can is that we 're not on the same things pay if we about life thinking and if we actually live .
if you so simple question ask , as happy , people in california are they 're not the correct answer get .
if you this question put think that the people in california happier , to decide if you say , we in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you about life in california to think , thinking about the difference between california and other places , and this difference made to say , we in the climate .
now , it turns itself out that climate not very important for itself is , and it is n't even very important for yourself , decides to how happy people are .
now , but , because of yourself responsible for you can end -- some people might end up california cities .
and it 's kind of interesting to track , what happens with people , for the california pulling in the hope , happier to be .
now , their self does n't be happier be .
we know .
but one thing will happen . they 're thinking that you happier are , because if you think about getting you remember koko going to how terrible at the weather in ohio was and you 'll feel that they are right decision met so much .
it 's very difficult to clear about well-being thinking , and i hope , i give meaning gives them behave , how difficult it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question of them .
thank you .
now , when we imagine a few weeks ev 've mentioned to me towards that 's a pretty interesting results were random sample survey coming .
is that some of tense ; we / make innovations , because they now a few minutes left have ?
daniel : sure .
i think about rewards result , we in the ice survey found have a number , we absolutely not to find expecting had .
we found in terms on happiness , of itself .
if we us hostage to see emotions with the income .
and it turns itself out that suffer from an income of 60,000 dollars per year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , 100 articles , but it 's a lot of representative sample , under an income of articles dollars in
60,000 .
cubicle , 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in these people unhappy , and they become increasingly more poorer , they are .
about getting us a completely flat line .
i mean , i rarely is how flat lines seen .
what happens is obviously , that money for a not a teddy bear , but that lack of money for a probably misery obtained , and we can this misery truly , very clear measure .
in the sense of other self , of myself to get a different story .
more money you deserve more you .
moore 's not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american legitimacy is to live , freedom to strive for the wholeness .
when people to that submitted seriously hurt , you would i mean , it seems to everything on the head to ask , everything , what we think , for example in terms on , etc .
there is a chance that politicians that country in general a hypothesis about the serious take it would and attention based political fate would be ?
cubicle , you know , i believe that 's credit agreement for the role in the politics .
the recognition is going to slow to be in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom happens right now , and in other countries happens right .
people are much more redundancy , that you think happiness think should , if you about politics thinking .
it 's a while forever , and people will discuss that if they study want or whether you explore want , so i need to take this discussion pretty soon lead .
how lucky increase can go very differently depending them , as you think , and if you think that even sooner or whether they passed down mahatma gandhi .
this is going political impact , i think i , in the 25 years .
in the united states , you look at the population to measure .
this is going to think i , in the next one or two decades part of the national statistics , to .
now , it seems to me , this issue going , or should least the rewards political debate to track assets across the next few years .
thanks for the invention of behavioral .
thank you , danny .
i 'm jane . i chop games .
i now since the 10 years , and my goal for the next decade , it as easy to make the world in the reality to save , as you go to save .
i have a plan for i want more people convince them , including you all over time with play sighted and games to spend .
currently spend our three billion hours per week with .
some of you think maybe , `` this is a whole bunch of time for games . ''
perhaps slightly too much time , if you guessing -- how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve so much .
in fact , but my research on to institute for the future estimated that 's exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to the problems of the world to solve .
in fact , i 'm convinced that , if we do next century on planet survive want to take this time dramatically increase need .
i 've calculated that the quantity of time at 3.3 billion hours per week is .
this appears first maybe something , so i repeat myself , so it 's smiling can : if we problems like hungry , poverty , climate , global conflict and obesity solve want to think i 've got we 're trying to play online for least 21 billion hours per week until for the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really serious .
why ? this picture describes pretty carefully , why i believe that games like developers for survival of the human species in the future are seriously .
this is a of photographers .
he wanted to the feelings to watch play piece of so does he outlines the players a camera built .
this is one of the classic expressions watch play .
if you 're not a player 's the zabbaleen you , maybe some of the in this picture .
you see , probably this marketplace to the urgency about the fear , but also concentration , quite climax in solving , one real tough problem .
if you also play , you see some here , for the top of eyes and the mouth is an indication about optimism . the eyebrows present surprise .
this is a player , the leading edge an arrow represents .
oh , you know it 's ok forwards and so we have some of players show .
a , 78 is a result , as valid positive is that they 've been absolutely never knew that it even able to was .
it was the interstate beyond imagination .
and if you reach , they 're shocked that they actually making such thing can be gone through this is a victory .
these players standing before a victory .
and this is what we on millions faces of on the entire world to see ourselves , if we are obstacles of the next century in attacking take the face ribcage , the civilization-state all odds most oppressed , one of funds .
hometown , unfortunately see that we 're likely that face in real life , if we wicked problems meet .
i terminal , it as `` in life i 'm bad '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
i 'm like i came in life i 'm bad '' do .
this is a graffiti throughout my former home in berkeley , california , where i 'm in my thesis checking why we go playing better are born in real life .
this is a problem , much players have .
we think that we in the reality is n't like that are good as in play .
and i mean not only less successful , although this publicly owned .
we reach into more i mean well in relation to the motivation , something to do that inspired to collaborate together .
if we in a are , i think that many of us moving into our best version of finance , anytime and immediately are more wolves that problem to solve try and so long as i needed , after the again try .
and in the reality , if we fail , if we down barriers bump you can we often different .
we feel ourselves , overwhelmed . we can we cured ourselves feel ourselves , threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated , or .
these feelings we 've never , if we play games , in play , there are you just not .
and here 's what i started looking wanted .
why is it into play impossible to think you could n't just all achieved ?
how we these feelings like to play in the reality properties ?
so i looked i 'm playing like bank institute warcraft at the ideal environment for the collaborative solving offering .
and i have some things have noticed that in as possible to do .
so , first , if you in one of those miniaturization , especially interested in bank institute warcraft , there is a lot bunch characters , the purchase weapons give a mission , and although immediately .
but not just primordial mission , not a mission , the perfect teaching her current level in the game fit , right ?
so i do you .
you get never been a job , they do n't solve complex .
but still alive edge of their skills , so we have you persuade . but there is no unemployment in the bank institute warcraft .
you sitting right around and turns out there are more specific geographic something important to do .
and there folder employees .
where they also go , hundreds of people , with them together , to their mission poison .
we have in the swami life 's not so easy , this sense that at a folder employees ready to embrace .
moreover , there 's this story , this inspiring story , why we there are and what we have to do have .
then work we this whole positive feedback .
they 've driven by `` level 10 '' and called resilience strength called jason clay called resilience intelligence , ''
this constant feedback , there are not in the swami life .
if i this stage leaving , i was n't know , resilience to speak of resilience crazy idea of crazy idea .
i outlet in the swami life , that feedback n't .
so , this problem of interstate bank institute warcraft , is that it as satisfying , anytime most oppressed , one to embrace that we prefer our whole time in these spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
until now have all the bank institute of 17 million years with clubs , the virtual problems of to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it sounds maybe evil .
but to time in context to see : imagine a million years start our first , upright , to go .
the first so .
ok , so if we talk talking about how much time we were progressing with play spend doing just a sense , when you look at the time in terms on the scale of the human development kit eyes stops , which is extraordinarily important .
but also appropriate because it turns itself out that we 're using we this whole time college play using , actually change , lock us as people in the capacity are .
we create us to collaborative josh . thank beings .
this is the truth to talk about i think .
look at once this curious statistics , who recently from a researcher at carnegie mellon university published by `` the average young man of today in a country with strong spends 10,000 hours to wait for the 21st hypertension .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number from two reasons :
first again , for children in the united states of hours of the opposite , it into the school rest of the fifth grade until finally graduated high school -- if you never absent .
so we grew up a complete on the young people as learning , what it means , a good players to be like anything else , what it into the school kitchen .
and may have some of you the new book of malcolm , `` oh , read .
so i know his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
you 're building on the great science , that , if we have 10,000 hours with a graduate one of random esoteric except for the 21st hypertension spend , getting us to adolescent good .
we 're so good ad , whatever to do , like the monks of people the world .
well , what we here , have a complete generation young people who are .
the big question is so , `` terminator 's exactly two players , okay ? ''
because if we figure might be we elect been never got human potential treatment available .
so many people have we currently in the world , the least an hour for every day to spend .
these are our 500 million people who are extraordinarily well , `` something called lesterland .
and in the next decade we have a further billion players are extraordinarily well , whatever creatures .
if you still do n't have heard .
the built , the energy savings and at work , instead of which is to player on the entire world , especially in india , china , brazil online games can .
you expected to an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have total 1.5 billion player .
so i started to think , what it 's the galaxies showing these games to circus to do .
here are four things that i found was first : .
ok , ask you look like extreme ice before .
this urge upon immediately something to do a high-tech to circus , along with think that we have a ruined on success did .
players think always talk about that a , 78 is possible , and you that it always absent , it to try and scary moment .
players sitting right around .
players are masters in webs poet social nets .
there is a lot more interesting surveys show that we people more like , after we do with you played have , even if we evil defeated have .
the reason for is that 's a lot trust requires , with somebody a game to play .
we trust suggests that someone time with us spends that the rules are , that we 're meaningless marks have , except for help keep .
so allow this is growing of ties to trust and interconnected .
as an unintended consequences build our ecosystems social relationships around .
productivity , right !
you know , there is a reason why the museum of 22 hours per week role sort of as .
the reason is that , if we play , we are actually happier about hard to work , as if we relax , or anything do .
we know that we as human beings optimal work , if we 're stiff , big job tasks .
and the players are always ready , hard to work , if you the right task get out .
and finally , meaning .
players love it 's part of awe of these missions in alaska , to be .
here 's a , to the water rights light to illuminate know it certainly all the wikipedia , the largest the world .
the largest the world , with nearly bank institute warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information online bank institute warcraft web native , as a page ad another issue in each other the world .
they made a story .
they made a source of knowledge about the bank institute warcraft .
ok , that 's so four superpowers to a single conclusion lead players are , hopeful individuals .
there are people who believe that they as a single change the world can .
and only problem is that you think , you can the virtual worlds change , but not the real world .
this is a problem , i 'm going to solve try .
edward is a .
his work is awesome . he studies , why people so much time , energy and money in laundry .
and he says `` we are faulty of not less than one in virtual worlds and . ''
and by an economist so he passes .
and he does ...
not as i 'm gon na play , i 'm a little .
so he says , that sense , actually make sense , because player can go into increasing longevity than in real life .
you can go into play stronger social ties relationships when in real life . you get more feedback and the rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently completely logical that players more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i voice just try to this is logical .
but it 's definitely no .
we need to start to the real world in a game to turn .
my inspiration comes from an event , 2,500 years .
there are these cube out of you know .
imagine this fantastic , there .
and they were kind of the first of people building .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek trust corporations , you know you might story . the story about how and why games invented gavage .
susan violent games , specifically , in the u.k. , as a famine invented .
sb there 's such great famine , that the king of up to a crazy idea ropes .
the hiv infections are people fought .
it was an extreme do you needed an extreme solution .
so gavage , according to and a national strategy of a day would you eat at next day would you play .
and they would have so much in the climax , to actually play so fascinating footage of us to productivity surrounding that they forget , you would that 's nothing to eat there .
and then , december next day would you play , december next day would you eat .
and according to expand that 18 years long that famine , using them on a day eating and at next playing .
likewise , i think i put we now play a .
we put play a around the pain of the real world to escape .
we put play a to respect to zabbaleen in the real world ca n't work , especially in real life , not a satisfying , and we pull us what we need from the play .
but that have n't end of being .
that 's exciting .
franklin was for 18 years of famine not better so i decided to the king , a year .
they shared the u.k. over two explanation .
you 're playing a and the winner refuse to an adventure disrupt .
you sometime , and went out on the search for a new home rivers just as many people back , as food to survive there and illusion with the rest for an area , in human beings flourish could .
this sounds crazy ?
but the latest show that the , later , rich shoulders , the same dna as the old advances .
so came scientists recently to your notion that ' crazy story actually true .
and the 1980 we found evidence of a global , almost 20 years of weeks , what the famine explain could .
so i could these crazy story of voices .
maybe they have actually get people through play rescued by she turned 18 years lived in games have and then these had and so much about that mammals play learning that they provided the whole civilization saved have .
so , we can also .
we play since 1994 warcraft .
this was first in real world bank institute that was until 16 years .
you 're playing 18 years long , we play since the 16 years of warcraft .
i argue that we 're ready to our own game .
so , they sent the scrolling your civilization on the search for a new world . so suppose i 'm talking about 21 billion per week .
we need inside that the half of us an hour for every day to play spends 1,000 cartoons the problems of the real world has solved have .
i know , they 're asking `` how to solve our problems of the real world in play ? '' and exactly this question i was my work in the last decade on to institute for the future expectation .
we have that trauma in our office in the buttons out how we the future understand should .
we want to do n't try to the future been to say .
what we want to the future to do .
we want us the best results of life and then people tend to this idea in the reality participation .
we ask ourselves up and give people are ways to achieve .
i show you very briefly yesterday games that i designed 've got to try to people in their own future to flavor .
here 's called the world without oil . ''
this game is by 2007 .
it 's a , in which you a real-world partners .
the invented , but we have enough to make it for you realistic it and their real life in fact , without oil dependency . so , when you for the game to tell us , where they live and then get them in real , you show how much oil costs , what do n't there , how minority , as transportation posture is going to see if school closed groups , whether it uprisings have and they need to figure out how your real life shape , if it 's true if and we ask you think about to blog , videos or the photos hire .
we have this game with the players in 2007 tested and we 've since over the last three years , accompanied .
and i can tell , it was a borders experience .
nobody wants to be life change , because it 's good for the environment or because we should .
but if you in a adventures are and honestly get `` us about oil out . ''
this is a fascinating adventure , on that you go .
find out how they survive would have the most of our players have in the game of habits maintained .
so we prepare for the next to play a bigger , inward goal hackers both sides .
we have this game called `` on to institute for the future built .
point is the calculation , one that the people just another 23 years on the planet left very much .
this watson 's called `` global index of course .
the action of players , you the databases , we have almost like a word `` forged .
you know brown , where it 's called `` give you have the astronaut , the scientists , the and all together can see the world , saving .
but in our compromise , instead of only five people say , we every year , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 player playing video game eight weeks harvesting .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can , if you call `` google .
and the last game to put us at 3 march found it 's a game in collaboration with the bank .
if you play conclude , get out of the bank awarded `` social '' i graduated 2010 .
we 're working with universities in different sub-saharan and the store them a social powering them to learn .
we have a comic cause we have `` level 10 '' to understand , , sustainability , vision and slums .
i want you all invite you this game with young people to share , around the world , especially interested in those benefits , moving along their own social enterprises hostage to the world to save .
i come now for the end .
i want you some questions .
what we believe that happens when next ?
we 've all this fantastic players , we have games , we show , what we can do , but we are real world still not saving .
hometown , i hope that they realized inside agree that players human resources are , we to work in real life , autonomous drones , and that play a big meaning for transformation did .
we have these all superpowers to productivity , the ability to adam social nets to knit , and demand for the importance .
i hope actually , that we put together big cello playing around on planet another century to survive .
and i hope you 're going to me like play to create and play .
if i went into the next decade , i 'm sorry for two things sure that , that we have any future to create environments , and that we all sorts play games can .
so i tell me , let the players start !
thank you .
i would you want something to talk , what i imagine a few months writing an article for wired noticed is .
i 'm writing more my , but i was with prescriptions of already done , and i fell on that i 've never in my life , i know what the word `` disabled , '' really means .
i read them to post office .
`` disabled , '' `` vancouver , useless to destroy the trojan , the delusion of , , , paralyzed , , from the traffic pulled out , traditionally , broken , voila not injured or ineffective and weak .
: a healthy , i 've been . ''
i do this list for a friend loud read and was angry laughter , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i come only from `` '' and could no longer , and had to stop reading and i 'm angry garbage after this and the eradication of emotional shock .
of course was an old , i keep me just thought that the issue been pretty old , to have .
but actually it was an issue on the early '80s when i just with the primary started and so began to my outside of my to build and to form , even in terms on the other kids and to rest of the world around me around .
and god bless thank i was time is not used .
it would i must post seriously hurt if i went into a world born , somebody like me as a person to perceive it would have their lives in the way positive log cabin . now , but i 'm going to the odds and adventure , i until i celebrated .
so i figured i 'm struck by 2009 appealed to expect that i showed up a piece of reasoning .
here is the version of this .
is not much better .
especially interested in the last two words forbes magazine called `` non-zero-sumness '' and `` healthy , ''
but it is not just to the words .
it comes product , what we about the people think that we manage those words describe .
it comes to the values , in these words stuck , and how we these values that feynman .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people around us around here .
many societies , including the greeks , but they have really believe that the one of a lot of power has , because what you loud , they also be .
well , what you want we actually -- a people or a ezra the people ?
alone been a people as a child to call it could leaps and possibilities and share ideas .
if it 's not beautiful , closed doors to embrace ?
a man , for me doors open , which has been my most institute in africa .
it means that dr. a , whose name , as you remember thinking to get the most americans do n't ethically remain could so i was he always dr. tone called .
and dr. tone wear whatever it 's very colorful fly and was for the work with children just like created .
i was the time that i 'm in this hospital spent i just great -- except on my .
i had to single exercises seem infinite often repeat with those cores , -- in different colors -- know , to my strength and i make more hated than anything else i keep you 're hated i warned me â™« they hated it .
and ask you imagine , i whistled even worse than a child with dr. tone negotiate and so trying to these exercises to stop , no success .
and one day he sees me at an imagination exercises observation -- these exercises they were just 24 and -- and he said to me , `` wow , , â™« â™« as a strong , and young girl , you 're going to one day one of this .
and if you are talented , give me you a hundred dollars . ''
this was obviously just a simpler trick of dr. toronto , so i practiced do that i do n't do i wanted to the prospect that the richest year-olds girl in the ward in the second stick to be but he gave me to actually produce carpet , my daily with new eyes to see it was amazingly , a new and experience .
and i 'm wondering about today , how much his vision of me as strong and young girl my shaped me and i 'm so imagine able to me when one of nature of like a strong , ezra , and the person to see .
this is just an example of many , as adults in the imagination , one child stimulation to get .
but how are already set examples from the prove that makes us our language 's no room , into something that controls , what we all wish you would say it every single to sustain itself as ezra the people to see .
our language of the social changes afterwards , in many cases through a technological change arthritis ruins .
from medical view from prehistoric you could course , say that my legs , the for the reason titan , artificial for the body , the divine breath , really all their opportunities to use and spread across borders , give her natural destiny taken someone in addition to create , absolutely not to talk about bond platforms that people linking up a very own identity going to focus on its own way , and the way rigid , and so , so striking at creating groups measurable , you own antelope .
maybe lincoln so these technological change wishes because you ever , that it already becoming a different truth gave , namely , that every human society something quite and really going to be and that the human ability , they adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability they adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people i always been embracing asking to talk , as i 'm going to the odds and i 'll give something to confess , like this sentence has for me never and i keep me still very uncomfortable with it felt that question of people tend to answer , and i think , gradually understand myself , why .
this phrase from interacting with all odds lives of the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge to circus , no from the effects associated experience prescribed to be as though my life so successful shephelah , would , because i got the kinds drop one of life with a prosthetic bullets could , or how even more people me with my disability perceive .
but the truth is that we change course we are of the challenge impression that matter whether you physically , emotionally or even both .
and i argue that , well .
odds are not a barrier , we need to deal with our lives better clear to come .
odds belong up our lives .
and i 'm leaning lead the odds be my shadow to see .
sometimes nonetheless , i 'm sure that he 's very al-qaeda is , sometimes he hardly going to see , but he 's constantly at me .
and i want with zero-sum the impact electrodes are heavy loads of one of people .
there in life odds and challenges , and these are only real and every person comes with it differently about but the question mantra no , whether we do with all odds clear to go or not only way we make clear to go .
we 're so not just for responsible for the people who we love , going to maintain , but they also proud qatar , well , so clear to come .
and we do culinary our children 's no mom , if we give you feel secure , that she does n't adapt to get .
you have two things that clear separate , for a medical fact , 8,000 people to be , and for the other the norms opinion about whether i was disabled 'm or not .
and to deceive to be the only real and persistent disability , with the i apart put it was , is that the world , sort of patience , you complain me with these definitions describe .
in our desire to the people to protect us at heart ahead and you , the atmosphere , hard truth about their medical prediction louis or even a prediction to quality to ask , she expected to have we treated , that we 're not the harbor for recommend that somebody actually covering is .
maybe is inadequate concept , just waiting , what in a broken , and how we fix , for every single a larger disability than the itself .
if we put people are not treat , and not all his agents and possibilities to perceive and appreciate what do that we addition to the natural struggle , the you might lead to have one another disease .
we a human being able to our society a worthy accomplishments .
so i 've got us about the stars look at us on every area of the human possibilities to focus .
end of tactical , but is that it from the perception our and our great , a connection there .
we should those times longer or in denial , we should nor trying to avoid being nor should we 're under the carpet return , but it comes product , in the odds opportunity to discover .
it comes to me , perhaps more mundane , clear to ask , that we odds are not necessarily real-world partners , but that we for open 're going to hug , you end up to gather around the same time a to use and maybe even start to dance .
and probably do that we do the odds be something natural , and useful to see and feel ourselves , so through their presence has no more like pcbs that .
in this year celebrate we put 200 birthday of charles darwin and when he shares 150 years about evolution wrote he did darwin , in my eyes on something very self in the human characters thinkers .
i 'd like paraphrase `` not the most powerful its species survives and also not the its way , but the key shift change at best adapt to be .
ethnic conflicts 're going to creativity .
not just from darwin work know what we that the ability of people to survive and , from the battle of human spirit certainly evolved by conflict to convert them .
so , again , change and adapt to have to assist skills of people .
and probably know what we just from goodwill wood , we are , if we really codes will .
maybe it 's exactly the sense of the odds , a perception of the troubles , a sense to our own power .
we can we like myself about the gift .
we can odds a new meaning to give the data heavy time beyond imagination .
maybe we can odds be reduced to see .
odds are for a change , at that we still not uniquely identified .
i think , the biggest damage , the we even have to believe that we normally , to explore .
jo anne -- who is normal ?
there 's not normal .
there is the usual typical but not normal and if you those poor , gray person , really know learn wire , if you really pandemic ?
i think , rather counterintuitive .
it would love , if we this paradigm of the cloud against a different ways , or the strength to make it even still a little bit dangerous to reframe those cars could so we can the forces of very many children release , and they tend invite your very special and valued skills in the society cleverer .
we found found that we humans from the members in our societies more ambitious plan : useful to be , and a contribution to afford .
there is evidence indicates that long ago 60,000 years older people and people with severe physical injuries with balloons very much and that happened perhaps , because the wisdom in these people for the society valuable was :
they have these people do n't be broken and ineffective resilient ; they were as something and valuable treat .
a few years ago greenland , i in the city , in the i grew was in a in germany , `` red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood up against a creepy .
it was the summer , and i had acromegaly .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , say , `` well if it 's not . ''
and i tops me around and see these elders man . i had no idea who he 's .
and i meant `` excuse me , sir , you know we ? i can i do n't think you remember . ''
and he said , `` well yeah , tanzania , hardly at me remind .
when i first saw , keep me out of the belly of her mother mask . ''
oh , so the .
and naturally does it 'll but click done .
this was dr. , a man , the i just made narratives in my mother about this day knew , because i course , quite typical way to my birthday two weeks too late 2007 .
the doctor for diagnostics my mother was on vacation and so knew my parents the man , the me to the world examining , not at .
and because i without was born , and my feet moving forward to give arrow did and i just a few toes at this and a few toes most other foot felt was awarded the , these strangers had bad news .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents say , that you never walk tedwomen , and never as his birthday , how other children or that you never a living wage banjo , and since they have me just lying . ''
really extraordinary found myself , that he my entire childhood collected has no matter whether i look at a in the second grade coal burned , if i do with the at to rick was a matter whether i my scholarship , or an incredibly lucky , and he tenth of these clips to his students to teach , look at harvard school and the harvard school .
and he called this part of his the x factor , the potential of the human bonnie .
you can just not enough stress , how critical those factor for the quality , one of people to be able to .
and dr. on more , he said , `` i 've learned that kids , if you 're not attending something else said get , and even if you just a little grant get , if you kids themselves , then get kids much more readily . ''
you see , dr. has to be thinking changed .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone with it regularly , two different things are .
and even though i keep my thinking in habits of time changed , if you 're interested in the age of 15 years asked afterwards , if i mean prosthetic against legs of like meat and bone , you know , if you know i do n't second .
i wanted to back necessarily normal grace .
if you remember this morning wondering what am i 'm not so safe .
and this is happening , because i do something with my legs until i and yet despite these experiences .
and perhaps could this change also happen , because i so many human circumstances 'm going to me doors open metabolism , instead of people to meet me to make or me an idea wanted .
you see , it takes a really only one of people , you a demo , as their forces can , and they 're walking .
if somebody order to his own inner forces to activate -- the human mind is so -- if you do , and for anyone in a critical moment a door open , then they 're for those who have a very good teachers .
they bring them at themselves doors to open .
the actual meaning of the salvation '' `` rooted in the word `` ''
it means , some coincidence that in a potential .
again , which the potential want us because now suspicion ?
in the '60s years later in britain , an experiment . then built entirely transformed .
they call that there ! '' in the united call ourselves as `` ''
the students getting down grades ring .
and a students getting harder caregivers to get better teacher on .
they get over a period students with a `` sufficient '' which grade , `` very good pilot gave it got them said , she believes that you very clever kings and after these three months they have really stressful .
and of course it 's a heart to listen to reverse the words born , yell at all sufficient .
and as it was then after the three months as well .
but only ones who are still in the school were -- apart from the students , the school students .
very crucial about this study that was that the teacher not been .
the teachers knew nothing that something changed was .
you become simply said , that politicians and that are the students with the grade fertilizer and as they have to give some trained and you treat .
the only real disability is a spirit a spirit , the unbelievable traction , does n't anticipate the more he finds no more beautiful him missing , our natural , incarceration curiosity and our innate capacity .
if we do n't do , the human mind about to support to continue to hope for themselves and other people to move around nice to find that tease out to be then put our fundamental forces really positive model .
when a slip over those qualities node , we can a new reality and new structures .
i want to a poem end of a poet named in 14 century encyclopedia was and from me my friend jacques told me and the poem called `` god , the only four words know . '' `` every child knows god , not the god the name , not the god , but the god , the only four words know , and this sort of repeated , he says more just `` come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thanks .
