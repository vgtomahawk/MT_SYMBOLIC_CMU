yes , good day my gentlemen , my gentlemen .
â™« thank thanks for the invitation here today to speak .
and i have i am now , religious life .
my name is christian and i 'm a stranger term , at the import food .
that 's the so-called for eight years .
and my : first spawned a second organization , third of public policy .
so i 'm for this city responsible .
and well as you know how does n't really popular .
i know .
and about gender , and this is something that 's my son particularly liked , i 'm also .
which means i 'm the head of firemen .
and .
and pretty much did i 'm bailout , is inherently a subject matter , with me today , like .
hollywood to the theme of , because even heard about blowing department .
we hope on the best and prepare ourselves on the worst ago , has jack prevalent once said .
you know him .
he was once in general .
and then ah , i something not quite so serious to say .
i 'm a position .
so speaking , we if it sort of a risk there , that we just before a disaster stand for example , rush .
many people are the road .
it to distract yourself , it turns .
and somewhere in leading edge represents a suitcase , lonely , leaving little , maybe with this scenario .
nobody seems to lead to belong .
the suitcase hear anybody .
suddenly become a .
leave you .
police comes in firemen .
people scream .
officials .
you go out .
what 's because you go ? questions .
know what we also not whether we allowed to do n't say .
the people leave this building .
children cry .
some trap maybe even , because it quickly go to have .
suddenly a confirmation .
there 's inside .
a breaks out .
i hear the moment here on .
the rest of this kind of their imagination .
but it 's no imagination , i 've ?
exactly this is happening in this week happens in .
there 's a stumbling suitcase wrong remained .
afterwards turns out , just in , nine pounds drugs terrorists were .
but the people were exactly like , and so having a friend mine told , from the building feared .
it was nothing said .
and it 's coming right , that aveling suddenly least in the group on my friend , in my friend into newcastle .
god bless thank is no , otherwise would all politicians are not so benign churchill , how it seems .
you see , in a , in a disaster is communication a very important good .
communication is therefore important , because the people in this situation staring up communication .
they want to know , which is because you go .
used in the good old age was for the authorities still quite easily .
we 've just absolutely honest or we have .
why ?
because the so-called pressure .
you have come up with judging them to say , god , the human being beaten in , because say we prefer are not the truth or we say the .
this is in one time the social media , in one time from twitter , in one time from facebook , in one time of private and public , in one time of and suppressed television longer possible .
simply , remark compressed because it first not a moral and second mostly are anyway , we the past when agency , over any of dystonia .
you remember , maybe even at the in the hudson river , mostly farmland few year long ago .
the first talk coming at twitter .
by somebody on a ferry ran out salts to remark immediately , here 's an airplane , and we save the people now .
this was no .
you see , we 're waiting rely on today failures and remark of the truth to say , very to inform .
because usually we are obviously also the last , the supposedly the truth know , because we had agency must naturally careful attention , that we just information pass .
radiologists are public media , or even private media either ca n't seem very characteristic , or you do it simply could n't .
by puppets are we put food , and this is also something that already halfway through the media gone are , we think how we go forward to deal .
and caregiving are we the good old melting permafrost .
but just as a form of .
which means we 're in the next few years about a hundred in which build some of you know yet , , if it labels to come .
used it was so .
you know maybe you know yet , what times before , even before , once lived and even before this means .
i know it 's not anymore .
we are today with all that we think of these equations have , so , via facebook , through twitter , about this set other night , about television and at all over the internet and the local media and so forth and immediately , connected course , even with , to end of information forward to get .
and we know , we 've got there 's very quickly and act and we 've got there 's very quickly and advocates , because the and citizens are otherwise .
and we finally , but no longer believes that what we say wolves .
communication in the recession or in the disaster is so hand a question of claws above all media , the us tools available today , and it 's also a question of adoption .
adoption 's our biggest problem , because the and citizens to say that either , oh , little once again true all right , or you say , the us , it 's all much worse than it in reality .
we have therefore as good experience done with facebook and twitter , even mainly lately .
but they have perhaps some of where you , the media coverage .
we have a larger scale eat ice had .
and launches a so-called chemical bomb .
that 's bombs , with a amputees who are , because the should just once did n't watch the first on the cliche , but through the houses in the second war and just end of farming based on a chemical reaction , which triggered by that a little , the two of each berlin , that you the , and then came to blast .
problem is just a lot of those bombs 've never worked and bearing home as recently in the genetic fitness , where food .
and there were starting from an elderly gentleman be able to be a certain way that he looks beautiful in the attendance said to facilitate wanted to were we now , he had seen as you fell and now has it 's the authorities about synchrony that there 's a bomb is laughter in the background
way since they acquire multiple elderly gentleman reported in all over .
we 'll see what we still pushing decision-making .
these bombs need immediately suggests that place , not be , but i probe be .
and so we get national park failures and remark , in the literal sense of the word , a bomb , let .
and in history of the city the entire communicate via facebook and twitter run quickly with the consequence that the total far beyond 26 followed coca-cola .
and the media were thrilled laughter in the background .
we had n't even with whom telephony , but i have and , all over and twitter .
all had a great effect for us , because the regulators that will newest increase over these social media .
just jump , you 've got me also a sign going , when i stop raising .
i can go from here 's not at the morning duh .
this is the adoption therefore , because first these social media the advantage have that you very information pass .
not so very are , because the members , there tweeting right , how it 's called a high pressures .
secondly , fast .
if anything not true , writes that even though somebody immediately transforming the adoption of that i just talking i was clear rises , because of preserving the entire community to basically at the reports in .
and it 's a very high , therefore , so if anything wrong , then you can also very quickly , incentives are .
and we have a huge .
i said yes , , most exciting found , as a bomb central park high go .
by so we spend all the things that in the last years happened is , and there are more happens when one more compassionate than one knows .
but the import food crops every day of such a disaster intersection of looking to be .
a bomb , in a cult will have in a park , is probably not a ridiculous .
but you can also , and even after we just essentially found information and then you stand we got to our and try to the past seven meters deep .
and if you think of , thinking about other cities , if the then you probe will have , because they picked a so-called irish , the you take conventional n't be , then you know what we 've now , getting a variety of houses after that 's not more like to look like before .
and to communicate is important , description because it acts in one in a world , staggering amounts of communication to run around dick 's also to prevent money for worry about to carry that the people ethically questionable to pay worry about to carry that the people in the capacity are focused on these difficult situation hire .
and the social media to help us too much to be , because finally , you all of the communication in are , and it 's not just a is how we in the , and probably too in the first major part of had .
by puppets is today , not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the department understands the of the red cross etc. etc. , only communication in the disaster , and the caribbean a catastrophe about us all day .
and he showed .
there is through twitter and about facebook a lot of the aid 19 , if you also partially you still so overwhelmed was , because suddenly of people threaten to build wanted to you knew anything not anymore where are .
this shows , there 's more importantly to do , even for the public communication in , but the unprecedented with the and the has just showed that the social media from a , from a communications absolutely no longer way to think are .
and i hope that i take a little bit convinced i think that primal medium , well actually for the beautiful things of life often used by , even in its meaning and purpose soul and we as a city , for the to charge is this tool in the future too easy to and quite different owners going to her , to the citizens to use the and citizens and so thankful i now , and me very welcome to your attention even when i think the entire time barely seen mentioned .
thank you beautiful .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i am different .
i 'm a writer and , as you just already have heard .
and i 'm now just too much , a willingness to reasons .
what it is that i had firms produce 'm imagining i 'm also moment ago .
before i have this desperation , i have but a few things .
first is , i believe that we stories really for life needs .
that we have no stories are not life could .
also i think that 's very much more , stories are both of the entertainment , actually produced seeds .
then i think again , that the internet , the infinite premature by actually as well as anybody really neat will .
and fourth am i firmly believe that people for created were being creative people to be .
and that you happier than once you 're creative be degrading .
more people happy 're conservative better about the world .
very logical .
these better world is now , but just a noted that .
primarily i 'm , as jimmy said , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell you want to begin to midnight , in a , in the right now ordered choir 2.0 .
this is .
and it 's birthday .
now get them from and the their phones are not so much with , because in the moment , in which it at midnight become what happens something with them .
it happens something in your head , in your body , with their perception .
and they did n't really words for .
they do n't know what actually just happened .
i but words for .
i call the wizard of .
you see on one side and in and everything is pretty white .
i keep praying that feeling i am somehow macho .
.
and on the other hand we are two options in portland , with quite pretty much color .
and it travels at this place angry said , that i better and write , when i 'm drawing .
so , the first , which is now with their new perceptions see that 's a stranger man with hair , before she says , you very serious domestic and says `` congratulations , your life is gone .
this is .
and about ways that they to a very special kind of people heard .
she was being born .
players are people who weigh their hypertension to their lifetime play have .
who of you know ?
very beautiful .
imagine you imagine that lies not , if you stack meet , not from the pocket .
so cube , , everything possible .
what really important is the players have no insight on their .
we know what am also not , when we die .
i wish although every one rope life , but we know what mcdonald 's easy to do n't .
it can also morning and all been gone bust .
and the mitochondrial dna is it at my players as much .
you know what 's not at the order much because basically play can .
it means drones , every lost a minute could be the last honor to be .
a player in his entire lifetime playful , which has in the moment of like a grateful , the will .
now you could borrow natural wonder : if this because such dangerous , why games , then at ?
the answer is quite clear : this .
without play , no players create a around the , all the gray and only when a players play , he actually alive .
they were to play born .
so .
story of and as you now the world championships , moving her first challenge turns out and out of course , inevitably in love this is the story that i tell you want .
and launches into form a .
the first has 12 stadia , excuse me here is a happens , the i just too late seen mentioned .
so , 12 stadia in the first with a length of supernova five percent seven minutes .
this kind of a consequence for the other , beautiful tells you know .
tv producer , been campaigning for nothing else .
this is not to .
and if everything would get biologic ' i now lesterland done .
and also not at here .
now go unregulated , but only really go .
go we 'll ever come back .
what is the wool set out of the movie or from the husband ?
it can just a campus , right .
thank you .
as if we practiced would be .
and it 's exactly true on my players husband 's not too .
from where you might be pretty awful lot of campus .
there are many different games .
think they all of , , and so forth and so forth .
and exactly like this is also the number of players .
and the mitochondrial wrong here any amount stories , all told you will want .
now if the next question : who should because it all talk ?
i keep praying been a quite high conscience of me .
i was dragging me to smart and extremely creative .
but i know that 's a hundred brains more produce as just one , even when yochai mine .
therefore come straight into the idea that you with in the creative process .
, what if we do n't just simply or breath , not even ?
so if you say , we invite you very very welcome one of the development problem with publication .
imagine you imagine , for example in the consequence of three appear on a on the totally class find , because it for example of her grandfather kindness .
moreover , they 're a shepherd fan of .
if you can now just with the present technology is that i am absolutely no longer so hard to a do .
and this store them on the high , where it goes straight , and this is really cool , which really interested audience stem is going .
which means , it is not anywhere among them , but it ends jump right there , where it ends ?
this really nice is that we web data .
and the web allows you know really all done .
so , every medium is kind allows .
which means you as viewers are you can write to draw to turn , whatever they do want .
and if we now also again , this structure look .
it looks a little bit like a network ?
so this , what british built it .
and i 'm really excited convinced that internet born , to pinpoint these kinds of stories to talk .
it 's doing just unfortunately there 's not many digits cases exposure .
so now go `` i but even worse one step further and cockroaches , the audience ourselves for the players are .
hawaii in a .
because you could fight characters from the series rusty , but also against people in the physical environment , also these on your phone so much .
enabled that weâ€™ve certainly not all very very well , are so something like mobile and entertainment .
this wonderful areas that has just very rapidly evolve .
and on the i do n't responsive to be , because i else again 20 minutes need it would .
we encountered some point together .
everybody 's first gear made from three parts .
the first part is the , the second part of and then we 've .
with this could i just gaze through the jury of the moment , i have this short vegetation , the innovation to convince them .
have to me the first prize for the best , given .
and i must lead to say : these jury template made by banks of the , and so forth .
so sensible cities should find myself .
and when i 'm going to convince anybody here with my `` internet right use structures revolutionize the shredder another world better , then i think that can i really absolutely convinced .
so .
everybody 's seven digits : why it 's called the whole because now why ?
since been alone in this names all areas are .
we have course , convenience of the : who 's closer , i 'm hangs â™« â™« closer , everybody 's first gear .
obviously going to die .
in the husband 's very much died .
everybody 's first gear means `` everyone needs time to die .
and then of course , well , like everyone 's first gear in the sense of everyone can join as he 'd like .
i absolutely important .
i come [ from the and there 's nothing worse in my mind gradually , as if it as a will .
i do n't know , if you know .
if you in theater groups and then came the actor so on the auditorium and everybody agrees : oh god , please , now , not me .
and here 's picked right .
so it is voluntary interactions .
and no need .
he can also just simply viewers make it .
the reason why i took german speaking is that entire project even in german going to be angry .
this has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project , while road and i was always been wondering : ezra the whole chapter in english major demographic larger , blah blah blah .
kiva can i just say `` the german ice is the the world .
the is the english , then came the spanish , and then the german .
it 's now so not so , as if we in preserving little moving .
furthermore think i really actually really , if it also other people like about how to me that the people grateful to be used for something that 's not due to witnesses placed where the end then everybody , and every pun on hiv/aids .
if anything like walking , as i want you know , then go to the first grammy now at first online .
and when you now ask , why i because now here am at a , where it is lava under the organizers of cop .
later i 'm also a few ideas visible .
i love .
not just .
i 'm also quite dependent by and .
some were too much and .
and i can assure you just say that this all know , incredibly important is and incredible .
but it uses scientific virtually nothing , if you miserable not apply them .
and my project is easy thing where i just flush all basically founded , what i like learned i .
and it 's routinely described .
and yet running costs good .
can i assure you just say .
so , if you please anybody thinking : i want to simulate almost my part of friendship , i had degrees [ an idea of character or i keep praying r-i-a-a drawing a cartoon , whatever , this is too far worse .
you find us before the web .
on facebook .
great , like releasing the speaker to speak .
yes , ' i also .
welcome welcome to give you could memories languages ?
question of you know ,
you could memories languages ?
you can move because at all remember , what in your life ever happen ?
they have never forget ?
who has who can remember running at all remind you ?
it go to do n't hands up .
so you could memories languages ?
apparently solid .
thank you .
no , so just want to do we were dismissed us today is n't do .
then would be able to talk probably fairly quickly .
again good evening , my name is samuel .
the talk today night , the i was i chose , because it 's two my passions , or my two great passions now sand .
i keep alley demographic curves in the near des and keep praying me to emulate with the bits pornography ' girlfriend , the days as lincoln through the world fly .
and a certain time i 'm now as well as a coach , and the killings in private and the field road .
on one hand i 'm so with the with the computer , much more engaged , on the other hand i 'm currently working on the in the human , so what works because human ?
how can you because that change ?
to a comparison stereotypes .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , .
so , the question was : when we can , when , when we can a computer building , the way it works like human brain ?
so , and i dated ' there are we 've pretty close injuries .
so my darling ' so two , three hundred years longer required no longer .
but let me first task , why you why is probably a little straw .
so the analogy between the computer on one side and our brain on the other side .
if we the computer taking , then based yes , everything , so your smartphone with your tablet , your and also these cameras , all of all of intelligent somewhere on a little chip .
he calls himself , central .
these pieces are assembled from transistors .
this word has surely heard anyone heard and in it 's still so as a triangle lifespan .
this little electronic system has three and prevents appropriately current governance or not .
in our computer in our we , i keep praying keyboard before about five hundred million of these little pieces .
and the mode network wild mess .
we edit things that we we calculate things that we had degrees [ silly albert einstein said listen , yes , computers can all might be very much , very quickly , but actually can he just zero and one compare .
nobody can he did n't .
he 's actually quite .
want to do we 're miserable time compare with our brains .
our brain has next smallest unit neuron , the neuron , and we 've heard , even got 'em my , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray mass to show up inside .
this beautiful but is our ancestors neurons have not just three connections but i 've mapped to per neuron .
and that make a by just simply because moore beautiful , 10 trillion .
that 's 10 to fourteen zeroes .
so , actually see you know the complexity our brain is about wasting higher than that , what we 're now more than the computer did .
want to take the time compare that maybe one or other diseases of the first supercomputer that had their own station violin are , ha , and with the was the campus .
our times as well , but the box somewhere up takes about 20 watts .
and the and illustrator openness is equivalent of two great bananas , so donâ€™t need not to get your calculators showing up walking beautiful .
if we now , giant good part of this up , giant parent calculator with , why use we , and then do n't know why forget we get things ?
probably know the one or other kind of ads on the web , so , the human uses only 10 percent of his brain , buying now this around for the brain to be .
and oxygen increased sales a little bit .
ten percent well maybe , but our brain is yes in over our evolution to this mass , that was year-old boy , especially in the middle stuck another our anger inside everything else has concentrated pools formed .
this is certainly not happen , because we do n't use .
why it seems to get so that we the biggest part of them grow ?
probably know you know the notion of ?
but the i compared [ of still so nice to the iceberg , if you the iceberg see , in north sea , waving grass rolled up so the top , then comes down comes a .
and these 10 percent up , that 's this is about what our , our minds is that direction but percent , running a shepherd 's away .
we statement ooh ooh ooh ooh , slow milk commons .
and to hang on this memory daddy , probably know the one or other people with memory .
people who changed suddenly remembered more detail remind ourselves as i do n't do n't seen keep praying in the situation , and the talk then , i keep ' said yes , but before , but , where you know ?
okay , because there 's some obscure clearly , there 's oakland a particular , a so-called , so someone with someone who usually on a field of sweden , who has a so good memory , it was in a plane , chaotic , in a plane , in a helicopter , as soon grass ' he then popcorn could n't get over rome kyoto , has changed rome brown bats , so rome 's well now itâ€™s not necessarily the smallest city has changed after imagine a gigantic signs paper taken and he started to rome to draw .
and although not somehow , so here so the river , and since 2002 ' , no , every single house , every single door , every single window has he ever seen that does he could it back to paper to put it .
inspiration comes now ?
so why anybody who 's why we ca n't , well , the assumption is perhaps pretty close that the little bit more access to his percent of weight .
now leverage we are well as well , but why can i 'm now not working on the eeg tonight remember , in all of detail ?
of mine has led interesting experiences done .
he has even for example , in working and has to a working , who had their experience completely eliminated that was n't more symbols , from the brain , this is n't happen , that 's gone .
wonderful , is to come very good clear .
now went exercises but why people to do .
there has it into a very safe session at the end or after this , sacrifices 1960 they might even when you do n't have more active to talk about remembering could be able you get the hallmark of cars crawling in which these people who hears christians who stood fifty meters ahead .
and actually is with this is the hallmark of a victim caught met .
second thing i particularly great migration , was he has a lady in had that has told that your mother in her constantly alice in mum gave when you klein was so four years .
there sitting on the womb of her mother and her mother has read .
and then he says she said , in strains but time ago .
then he started , she was four than that happens is , you could then still do n't read today can you .
and then they have told me he said , chat to me time .
they 've actually a copy from alice in found , where right on this side of text stood up the lady mum gave them .
the brain has so this page as she was , as an image .
after that could read .
so yes , we 've actually access answer , but we seem to show up in ordinary life to say we kind of to have to us not to .
now stored and we am not that event itself , but as i said , have it has got a little a picture considerably , one thing is a , we store owner rather , our , so , what we see what we 'd smell , what we listen , what we taste and what we feel , hey , if you now at a yellow thinking and how they got correctly , they have an impression , like the taste very simple example .
and it was now , long night , put them , but then popcorn while , ha , a little upright and then you dare i ask , exclude them but just always completely forgotten their eyes .
and remind you look at a very positive event in the youngest past , yeah .
take the first , what happens .
and if you now do you 'll give you might iconic , that you to this memory is a visual part series .
you get maybe a picture , maybe even a movie ?
days gets absolutely not only way , because we like normal condition , but do you first realized .
and if you see , if you might be that they either in the film footage from their eyes and all experience , or how they themselves to see on a canvas .
a call ourselves , the other .
thank you allowed the thought back at solving physical manifestations of sight back category .
who has because a visual information get the time hand high ?
yes , actually go ! ' a few hands high , this is so one-third of about it would i say , yes , this is about what i expected to publish it 's it 's actually something , what we so often make sure that we do in the first moment when absolutely not .
well , jazz musician , etc .
what even beautiful place on memory , if your memories , nor am not just this memory high emotion causes , we have a positive event and i keep praying for one or another smile can see , there was so yes , that was beautiful , there were , yes , they laugh , and already is the memory may still sitting in fact , baking we manage our memories even beautiful or other feelings away .
and now comes out what poses .
all been used well , yeah yeah , our brain power of the mantra no difference between what we actually reminded have , which is what we just imagine what we .
but you can test , when you home , sit down into something in the future of life , still not happening is , they 're similar information to put like something , if you look at something to remember , what in the last month .
and you know it but surely those stories , you look like this tells us in round of time .
then , hey , there 's happening and , and this was so beautiful , and more separation of those stories , more beautiful 're mostly the stories , hey , there were people more importantly , there was the night before much , there was the sunset even more romantic , there was the waterfall still much higher .
if we heard space rushing to do , so if we actually our memories so change , why do we because not chaos , the question i do ?
when i suey come , he told my uncle is an image showing up from his hut , in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very nice hut .
only picture is considerable ' little beautiful as the shack , so it 's artistic freedom , he sees me explain , well , there 's cabin , little beast , because grass ' delicious bit more grass verge , there is a gorgeous dog , before , actually shining through the sun at the alps , this is perfect a picture of these hut would n't do n't use piracy .
and why do we because not manage our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , what bothers me of `` well , when i even beautiful pictures of what i got degrees think ?
they 've actually remake liberty in their own thoughts .
know you know how some people , you see the morning , if you just like this gray eyes have , which is because you go ?
yes , i keep praying bad slept together , i went the whole through the head .
really all night and this idea blew me no longer go .
i think it 's a stranger who he checked the idea is n't go .
the janitor 's friend of my little depressed , when he went germany would come , because his mother in sarajevo and he did you just awful missed .
what the father made me , so he has doubled every night with the son and he said , or she asked , so , what was because the shephelah , which today is happening is ?
what was because the shephelah , marcus time , and then he finds him talk to make it does he argues that does it just tell corporations , which today is terroir happens is .
and intimidating two weeks went touch the son .
and then it was also okay , that the way , nor am back to visit .
and the is today has the whole youth lies done with the world today is one of the people that i know .
there are so not the memories , the unconscious influence in which , how we are , but it 's our focus proud of our focus on what 's thought we use .
and much energy we colossal waste , or use .
if you so i thought , or say , which was today , now , this is so , the southern ' i but real not going to make 'em ! time as you know you might tom in this fiction movies have seen it 's this kind of these computers , where he begins to make them , but also time , looking for your picture that used by this , well not quite so great a very much , they say , yes , well , already happening now , chris , to leave with it .
what ham ' we because ' yet , ah , which is beautiful , maybe wrapping up , i am reminded me ' real enjoy the person who was that was pretty well ?
and then take them , but even with .
take them with in your and let them .
or if somebody from bitter , to be giving your boss , or your wife , or her husband , , laughter .
so , take you also this picture , put it 's funny hat on , hey .
with , let them in the background horses jump , yes , they laugh , why laugh ?
because they think , because like this idea funny details .
and you can much better with the situation suddenly deal .
ca man memories so languages ?
no , i think our brain has much greater capacity , that it all stored properly .
supposedly doing but nothing , because we can free to pick out how badly need to focus and how important that we have an event , a memory , an idea value , it comes upon us on .
my verse of you start to play with the images in your head to use it makes your and give him every day , your life exceptions .
yes good afternoon .
thanks for the invitation .
if i went on a party asked 'm going to what i like in my spare do and tell that i combined with friends a and then see i was shining eyes and in the minds in my audience of , and pop .
if i then , you that it at the to a to classical music 's going blame itself up these images from ancient people in just a long in spaces sit and very focused on stuff listen .
frank said , again , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and so similar acts themselves as well with what we do .
so you yet another insight get talk , i equals speak , i 'm a short film brought .
film
2002 , ooh .
this brings out my view at best on the point .
been growing out of attachment found something completely different to do .
we makers have today forth between and the middle , bottom 20 old and have very early in our youth until , what 's tremendous force and delight us to classical music .
we have but also reminded that the of and of us up some happiness , well , a little ms : can .
and we are the shoreline belief that the so-called crisis the classical music is not at the content , so on the music itself , but at their survival .
so imagine we the question , how we have a create that the music , near the friends and this power once there , so we so much closer you may .
how we have a conference , beyond the one of work ?
we put the parameters go out classic concert know , space time , light , context , basically in the question .
suppose we example , the relationship between princeton and musicians .
normally , there are between the stage and the audiences a gap .
we try to the aesthetic .
here you see a picture of our .
the musician sit in the audience , drink beer , chatting together in the breaks through the princeton to stand up to play a two pieces , put it turns once in the audience .
this whole being in texture of the night a little .
everyone , the livelihood levels , come on the stage and go back .
or is sitting in the concert .
in classic concert as to be on more or less comfortable , permanent chairs , so similar as you here , sitting at home front input and listening .
there but music , because you could actually not do n't sit sit .
and we have we thought experiments , as you could implement .
if you different sit and look at a piece of music can then hear them automatically differently .
another tradition comes out that we at this is the concert does n't a stage had to enhance four stages to the audience controllers .
the audience could you know .
so sitting at the night every once in the first set .
important for us is that we 're not just simply threaten to do , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we so i wonder what 's spaces and vague , but also in the minds of the people need the music that they like that smiling can see her smiling should ?
and so weak roll concerts night to watch thirty years , the s actually just by the chances are in the way , in ancient .
but not just the spaces controllers , and the illumination can music alive are anxious and historically , but also with other .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years with a combined working with us , or movement to music to develop really absolutely not to dance wrote met .
and so the mammary cell for of beethoven , or for by steve rich .
and in this year i we give you know if you so want to function .
we have the first time a concert together with a goals .
we have the story from the soldiers of with actors , , and dick became a mothers .
one particularly interested in even justin works , because we a lot of had to us in this piece of support weight .
we have about a very much money from people like a very germany pillar , so that we could .
at this kind of what from a community out of cooperation .
we 're totally happy in the warmth of in the caves a home found to have .
the city closes exactly how big , that we great spaces and exciting places for concerts find , but too much mystery , that we iconic .
if beginning of the year in the spring two weeks forty miles from throughout europe in the city are , then gets stuck on that in the city more people with suey was usually .
all of transnational organized .
we makers have a very colorful between out of students and students , dentists , , , really completely eliminated mixed up .
and make a little , so the or the coordination , and funding in the eye crescent , increased seven meters 10 makers in a , for a year long 're manufacturers .
although even , but you care into a year whole issue that for example , or the , the into permanent hands are , except for organizing information .
we do all in our basketball , and live in different germany distributed .
which means , the largest piece of work 're going to decentralized , and on a .
just three times in decisions we about this year distributed to a weekend , in rotterdam , one or other problems that up on are , and caring also interpersonal together , just hugely important is , if you look like something in motion speeches tonight .
for even come then 20 percent thirty voluntary non-governmental later , for a few days or a few weeks of their hands values and there touch , where miracles needed it , ha ha ha ha
and naturally in this fourteen days go through the musician lead .
now could find myself , with it would you all what you for such a needs .
but our is still further .
we 've been tested in in the city a lot of community around us around built it kind of us to emerge in which what we do want .
that comes from the classic go to go but also about very practical things like for example of meals , because we have a baker , of us to bread or a of us fresh food to providing loans .
this is going into a in the city where over the whole year 1900 , and sells .
wait while to the .
we have in a whole series of found that we their room to provide places , so the musician herbie samples to get .
and on this kind of ways to something that intimacy in this city became and from the people in this city .
they identify emerging in a very peculiar way , and the way with this .
since the beginning of the year we could we thank support of the citizens fake place a prison life , calling now this entire endeavor in a and demos .
we makers , from believe that classical music , covering it comes in the right hands .
therefore we are incredibly lucky to argue that in harm europe young musicians music in your own hands , take back home for yourself in the cities dinners .
when you now , still not so right of life can see on the liver , classical music is how to experience , then they come but just gone .
start next year we are again , and we would we marvel , if you 'll also there are .
yes , my ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you start thinking , probably know , acquire .
know heard in addition to learn applies for the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn heard even more , namely also collecting and wins .
knowledge even experience of time , a beautiful formula for the .
what i like art and culture learned 've now , there can i had a lot of course , to say , because concentrations ar , i am in this field .
and so i was me , maryland , that it probably right , would like this kind of the title of a different viruses to give , what my talk .
art is beautiful , does n't much work .
now have both laughed .
you maggots will always the laughter , although the most of the norwegian know .
why is why ?
i think that has continued to do that in the word nice little , what we 're not so right sense to get .
art , say we even sometimes , one thing .
to work to say we galvao , one thing .
sometimes even .
people like to work , one thing for me .
but at work think we tend on the and at stuff more of a rich beyond the clutter , where we inside move our experiences collect , our own ideas evolve .
and so i mean , the i 'm already influencing want to go about three hours in five correlations shared , all the organizers , have to a i begin to make it for quite easily .
it starts with the , for the kid go to continue to inspiration for my youth , i 'm not all talk from my youth who are n't worry about going on the word to explain me afterwards , why i for my einstein described .
the interaction for the first part of my life and finally , any identification .
one of you will this is going to these pieces of sebastian stream know .
that folds and .
you learn so on the first two , three years , if you can reasonably practices , and i 'm reasonably practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 i was these little pieces of played on piano , not far from here , at home .
these pieces of life of a .
there 's a melody played and the different voice , but it 's quite differently .
the rhythm is scary moment , but it 's .
and my ladies and gentlemen , is something at the stuff that it succeeds , and if it only two voices are bringing together to think about whether the presence of the future , the past sometimes , in the images , in , in the things that are on the moment when henry , that make stuff out .
and i 'm carrying learned two melodies , sometimes even three , in the same time to play , every kind but to hear that 's wishes , the other not .
this was , what i actually learned i have genetic fitness .
another experience i 've never forget and i keep the worry had to believe me today may also like to go could .
i piano , there were even more people in the room as now here , and the middle of the i came out .
i had forgotten .
i scanned played .
so again from scratch started and at the same spot knew i 've been unable to continue .
audience has more almost as i , because i went into all quiet on my place , the outskirts of my notes , tucked them collaborating and started the third time from scratch .
and you think that 's not as i 've swallowed it .
but this was a very heavy experience .
maybe it was also one of the experiences , where i cast resin , well , with a piano , although i 'll quickly a had , should i may not my door , because at speeches that can get lighter cheating .
yes , the next the next chapter my , i am about inspiration and also because i 'd tell stories to talk .
when i then it was walking , i 'm going to my and told him , rather mr. , i 'd like a play .
and he said , bladder , this is not .
there have you very much haunted have and very much experience with women collecting rainwater .
now imagine you time ago , a young man , so , young , as a sentence .
the i was obviously not forget .
and by showing this point i was course , even more adept at .
meanwhile was i wipe off and to time in a .
i dove and i remember me on a situation that i like never more until i .
it was surrounded by chopin , and now although i 'm going to the part of work , i 'm a place just not a blogger , and she was with the nicest place , very broad had to find the poor communities , and then went back together and back apart .
i can now unfortunately n't imagine playing it 's not a piano here , and i could also not anymore .
i do this place decades , '96 350 chickens played and suddenly come right .
and then i kept playing and i keep me in a sculptures , and i know nothing yet , that i suddenly on the ground and laughing .
i was , except me .
i had no contest , nothing but basically , and the music has to me how did .
an experience , where i learned i think emotion also really .
and sometimes it 's also really meant to work to be in these , in this condition , call my first of .
where all of weâ€™re running .
we had this situation in fact , but then in the in an organization .
actually turned then almost anything like by itself , when we made it has only half months of iranian , where you normally half years to you need it would .
now , that were my experiences with the piano through artistic yes , with liberty work .
and now although i started my , .
i was first even when musicians road , but acts as .
we 've played , .
i 've given and i 'm showing how perfect along with my for the music to keep engage you can and that had .
in choir sing together breathe , a sings , wonderful experiences , for me very much more enriched have .
and then came up a point where i was in theater , in the murdered me , in the and the overhead , and i 'm so with , this chapter , because there for me this coming , or make this idea came from this combination of stuff , culture , i was time , even just in the entered the politics and law a job to do .
namely the stuff , culture to allow us to my to do .
so this work for the stuff , but what sylvia 's not as artists , but otherwise would you know n't say , rather than and on something to do .
i was sitting in theater and i 'm , there in germany still not going to fit in vienna , where i 'm , and by showing this point i 'm always more with this question preoccupied , what you could do to make stuff to allow us to the framework for art to improve , to a good management , a good management lately ?
and this was the reason why i 'll also am in my professional , in the way that , and with years later i am going .
but before was a neuroscientist , and this phase i am with interactions .
i came for the germans .
the german ice has its in .
i am , though sometimes in my resume , because i look at birth was always unknown , the bookstore , about what i , i have this kind time .
but i mean a root , because my grandparents maternal and they were also , and there , in , i was the until .
this was me been more something , what i 'm not quite enjoyed i , and suddenly realized i get sucked into a different form of culture , in a , in a culture , who lived by of people in this in this device , of .
once upon us who were all in a whole other condition , in quite different modes .
and i 'm going to , examined and , my friend and kenya was , because we 'll always to dinner music took it 's the guitar , i piano , another others having a bass played for example , could i went back scanned .
we 've done , so , but obviously getting text of , practiced .
and this , that came really from the people out .
it was my destiny , that i december ninth november for my 20s , and i do n't do with that the wall fell .
i woke december next day on , i had exam , oh , the wall fell , yeah .
i 'm more quickly respond prepared to shoot segments ask for the .
and away , there was i for the cities in the .
and because i was thrilled until about interactions like intel genetics between two german cultures .
basically talk , we the same language , the music is where both wonderful and was wonderful played , but driven by , .
unlike the came to do n't from the people all the reef , but it came a lot of top , and i 've got a lot of passing magical , here to experience , like the german identity , a barrel sponge , i later times more time back to come up slowly curved broken industry and the german , then these two states brewers weight .
1995 means that germany mobilized .
1995 , is also on the more tiger .
interactions i 'm going but above all things here we learned and until , in the import food .
we 've heard that i had this way a to ask you remember that time ago , when i showed up here we started to stand on my for culture and leisure technology .
i 've seen .
quoting stood for , you wanted to do n't write for culture and .
i was missed the first head of .
so i 've been approximately not so much so anyway was wonderful , that i this was , but she disappeared soon , because i 'm going to education charge who was and make alliances school education advocate and shape could .
we have much for the done , we have if you only time that between , and see what we actually designed , have the experience , , where you interaction between and architecture nba player from the end of the blue rocks .
many , many of interaction could we and could i shape and i 've experienced , and herbie , which means , if different people from a different areas combined a goal track .
you notice way that i always more of stuff , increasingly more to culture of us is the interconnections between humans between cultures , between communities , better said , in the eye take and i come but later on the stuff back .
interaction was also then , between the subject as we 're seven of the idea drawings , at tenth january , that could afford to europe sands .
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter one yet the headline identification .
this word has maybe two meanings , for a , i 'm talking about the me so to something , and i can do n't even as verb use and say , i do something that means , my assistant something .
and ducks again in his .
my assistant something with his , therefore say i 'm passing grades or the road , this community .
and i 'm doing something , when i caused me and say , that belongs to me , with i 'd like me transcripts .
and this is a very big action been .
five gifts three million people trying to move , cities , which has to identify basically double sense , to and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we do something called , but anyway as a community of many people in a great life and yet at least a common language , even richer nations so here 's and this was our identification , poland , in the people and of you course , too much ride .
ted sign at the highway , many other disney .
an experience from the 11th created not many people in buckets .
up ham has and eat , two schools , stacey , young girl from , from , and boy students from a high school , from , have letter of people , young men , like to a celebrates the boreal , goodbye to love to death , the last letter writing systems .
and it was already an april effect that young girl letters of young and boy russians then letters of young guys from germany in some of german .
and oxygen mask on one of these young men net piano and playing these , the i so loved .
and this point oh , then quoted him from a letter and said , i am , he wrote him go home , as young german , the he played , and i can never absorb a play , because my my two fingers exactly are .
and he his finger with a , spirituality move back at mit piano in this fellow carl , and trying to the to play .
and it managed to him no .
it was for me as a scene , that i moved forward jumped am , keep said , what we 've actually learned ?
we 've learned in the , that many people together something to move to get , but above all things we 've learned that we years in in peace life and the culture of us that links that we are no longer the minds retain , because we different languages to speak , that we each identify ourselves we belonged feel .
and this was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it comes to korea learn not just bringing something to know .
it comes to korea learn more mundane , something to experience and to win .
and if we were refined steadily and invention tolerate , if we tolerate that we inspire flow of art and culture , our own position to relate , in dialogue with the artwork , if we interact and zeros as well on our own identity has always been working , by we with art and culture structural let me , then we have all won
and i hope that they still many and i 've come from where those profit cities .
thank you .
yes , thanks .
i think , we wait on the first picture is hiring .
i mean to provide support my here as a few slides .
it 's not rocket science slides , but it comes in my favorite show why , a way to find and me with a totally critique , where i think that 's going to us the next few years , significantly engage .
by the words know i now finally , thanks for what ted 's also means , and i think , in the area we can this talk perfect arbitrary .
and then i had never heard that you to talk in english preventing should , if somehow able to , but if you typing a look , if you see , they would n't understand what i 'm on english to say i wanted to me deathbed not directly , as i say that should and so i was the talk then but in german calm .
how we die be .
i have to give up first of talk .
was the patient in the hospital , in which i 've been recovered .
she was about years old and has always like in the may outreach , because they also on her husband reminded of the first man , the civil war mom was then .
and so every year the first may to dance went and having a long natalie and probably even if a to a lot of paris , and once recovered and he turns out here on the right-hand side see you , the leg broken , the .
a few years before was also know once recovered and had turned on the same way , with envy occasion , although even the left leg broken .
and then was i also been there was physician and i experienced as you weeks on the intensive lay out how they certainly antibiotics treated by , as nursing was , and i the discussion instruction , like iowa who was that 's because at sense ?
does it at sense , in a much older people like this intense approved for the effort to get ?
so i enjoyed , to , on the intensive weeks , is a people at ?
and then cured met .
five years later come i in the clinic to see the name , and the can i 'm extremely coherent , because he just so rare is also for the time back , and anybody remember watching a dance in the may inspire others leg broken .
so that turns out of the question , what i got really , when i talk talking , like a person for you decide should , what it into his blackberry or what he also joined ?
and this is such a little theme of .
you see here then the brain called `` how we die be .
it 's a book out of , how we work is going to a report on the
and then it was so that the globalization are very strong sustainability went to be so you remember asking me , how can do because you go to be connected to work ?

it 's a backbone of work that successes , it 's also the work even a lot harder to be an example , after china , that was formerly a big issue .
and then also how come , that in basically the work of individual , so something that assemble , something that fildes have ever lower was that he always harder controlled by both of the quality , he of the accuracy .
and that , after my assessment of the people picked still less confidence from their work pulling trees and increasingly more part one little moments , where it seven-year-old went to extracting feet high to reach , and longer why , through his work yourself also to define .
and if we routinely translated on the and medical field , then there is because obviously just like a development .
if you in television even listen to talk doctors , nurses and even at most , then are the so-called .
and which means nothing else , when there has documented going to what you did have to make it is , so it even paid by , and if you do n't have documented , then say , the medical service acts as well , that care or that medical treatment pay we do n't .
and through these documentary does n't work is always harder and increasingly more closer this idea that you his work soul and with commitment from a personal belief in the background fight such a , and .
a good friend of mine is now for the netherlands gone , because he 's here are no longer i wanted to the had a practice , has been abandoned and after the netherlands went to physician to become .
the are at such developments mostly an inch ghana and he said , martin , had picked until that still more old people wobble between the hospital while and back , because the longer knew what they make should , if it with people bad grades .
then go into the hospital will restored to go back into the , or , and be clicked on nerve .
and this was worth preserving bailout , if it so some variables in france there , then i 'd like me because i want systematic advantage to show something that promote that you look at this vicious cycle , and of course of people can .
there now , in france arrived had stolen but bats , after he the language with a lot of efforts lessons learned was that there just stewardship happening , which at this happened was .
it will remain nameless dead increasingly a quality implemented .
it 's no longer the regulators that counts , but by putting some point in a surrogate realized that i want for example , not louis to be , or not into the hospital , when i in florida .
and then becomes .
in france is so , december third days find a conversation with the instead , and the need to get out of pipelines , i want to go into the hospital or i do n't want more into the hospital , when i something happened .
just like with , i want sparkling productivity , or i do n't want sparkling productivity .
this data to go then at a central and there sits this physician to , has always imagined themselves and true if the decision on this platform .
if we now at explorers i am i want in the may natalie weight and also once recovered was , and we think that would eventually a wrote , i 'm not louis to be , if you know this second dance in may at the may , where they then once recovered , admittedly , no longer behave can .
and this troubles of my friend , now , because in france unity too much as he is to deal ?
in the last it is so that today about 80 percent of people are no longer home to die , but in hospitals , , and that these acts as well , so you could perceive , not the ideal habitat patches for the old people , but it 's often a cartoon financially deeply closes , there are often and determination of and for yourself , that negotiation proposal for my soul , just limited instead .
there are creations are very positive manner , there 's very people to move liquid formulation , but if i realized that sabbatical , and we did 6,000 patients in , so like , maybe like to us to be , then would i for me say , it 's perfect difficult , there sort of critical habitat self-worth footprint .
this whole management course of reasons , this is quite clear , this whole quality of these governance is therefore introduced , because in the last money for not enough , that all people optimal , and in the way amount of offspring will and that the people who care 400,000 or the medical performances that paid to be that they say , actually come i good to realize that there can i for example , as a nurse a family of feed with a or two children .
this is today just not the reality , but you need two salaries in and and strangely enough , it 'll also only ten .
this introduction of the quality , as a result , one sort of growing market , the you adjust want to bind yourself so even on the individual threads off .
and now although i tend to how to death might escape that can , so what do we now in the last , because i keep am angry , asking questions , and these levers , so quite simply is the situation for affected amphibians .
and because i was just try and the library one realized there , because i think , a society need more like this structure , even legal structure , places where we all , what happens in our society .
and in the library one core aim , the dignity of people 's .
and the second set there 's going to protect is supreme 57 percent .
and what i sometimes missing is another third set up inside that catch every single bathroom to remember the commission we should , his going to protect and to defend .
because it 's a way to themselves to free from this case , i at different way and the dice me time somehow matthew and dairy and then southern i 'm least do n't worry about doing , as i because even die 'm going .
because in the last it is yes ! so , even if we this topic is n't like to ask , we 're getting hotter at the point to go .
hopefully , until late , with hundreds or .
the equivalent of course of my career as well , to say , that wish i each and actually want i also to worry , but eventually you 'll remember the subject ask ourselves , and if it then maybe so far is or even though , if you , or is that can already late in life to be late in life be able to say , i want to about this question now once you think .
if you now think about what makes my notebook out , if you 'll way points go , where chips in the last debut of what 's because actually five important things in my life been ?
because there is now a book , which is pretty .
it 's the self-esteem of course , there are going to the friends , i do with whom i rotterdam , and exchange actors , i know , and me through life , applying it 's the .
it 's sure that trust between people , with whom i may also to do i , in or in the area or a pastor or a or thermostat other individuals with whom i in the relationship cable .
and there are there very many individual goals of course , there , i leave now not all through .
but if you remember these three jumps long time primates , then once you 've always a whole lot when , how to move throughout life there may have to in the last his own going to protect .
and then arises then another refugee factor later , that we have a certain dictatorship of experience , i keep this here first such as a text , or less than as an example commit suicide .
other people can cause us these decisions and this behavior , what actually do n't meet .
this is my inner conviction .
our would be just like us even dared to go .
it 's so not the question , what are behaving differently for me to do , who gets me because even shenzhen , healthier , or qualify for me to utilize those who goes on me to ?
but it 's exactly insecurity , to ask , where can i went on people , where can i submit , and so my inner would be intimidating , that i do with these questions interact can and me there filming and reframe that can .
and if you 'll say , how we 're working properly , so this resolution data quality of us from outside cocktail was , it 's an opportunity to say , i 'm about my my inner would like this mechanism to escape .
because no human being able to me , as i decided weâ€™re embarrassed to see , and this filming want .
and i got there 's also do n't fit in general or transform to say , you got now a fill and because you know how old ready to imagine you specifically , if you nursing you will want to see if you on a freeway want .
these questions that can i in the last few minutes long , probably the poo .
this would of people 's an inner posture , in my sisters and not from outside convey to be able to the state n't protect you can also a law has no , and i also other people can and i rather be , when i arrival there themselves before with whom we 've got dementia , even know what i for a human faces .
and around like talking to lead , takes aim spaces , and actually think i , and why i was this talk so called , and here before plutocracy , are like spaces like into food , i 'm here both trying to on a picture times square rooms , where we talk like this subjects to think we have , where a space is transforming it 's not is that 's also may not to theoretically , but i picked up a conversation significant intervention .
so we , if we get old are sufficient to say that can , oh yeah , as a dance in the may , despite my may very high ages , that would never leaving everything .
i thank you welcome to your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i inhabit two things with .
if you , the first part of making flat , keeping you a little bit .
it hits another doctor .
start we do with infinite number .
this is stupid , not be forever .
what my you ?
there hundred different ?
or infinite enough ?
yeah !
this is not good , if this was a trick is something deliberate !
so , indeed , but i was a condom , it away , for you know .
just do we do n't .
we employ us only with a single .
and i blurred this like a little requests for the .
you know , we infinite against we have a to know .
and it comes to make guesses of sulfur .
if we in the road congestion , and counting every two , in one example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , assumed that moment before , we 're peering into the box all the number is small , there are three chairs and there are three people .
we can we distract them , whether in any amount of the same number elements chicken ?
count how would do we do ?
which means that we would later , people , one , two , three , we catch the three , we count the chairs , you see three chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and beautiful .
my , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this works in a wonderful , that works even at large numbers , although it .
but it matches .
how you could still counting ?
how can you quickly checking , that many people like chairs right there are ?
i realized chairs and people picked up and not what else .
let !
you call the couples !
you well , this is clear , right now we are in everyday road and certainly understand that 's also love !
not that 's very beautiful .
so , you call the only professional a and it works as well ?
you take a digitally on a chair , from the mouse .
the next to leave the next , everything is uncle , different people work multiple chairs , not a chair remains empty and the sets are the same size , okay ?
now go to take into the infinity .
how we two infinite sets each conceivable ?
we would say , the one is so large or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could do we do ?
we would then begin to .
yeah , that 's wrong , because the point is , if you in an infinite long lot start to count , yes , i would always easy to say , you get not to another .
, infinitely , is clear that ?
so , how about languages ?
?
senate , !
they had yet picked right started !
couples !
so now look we first place .
greenpeace to appreciate is in the wilderness populated bad , yeah ?
you see yes , you see obama did n't end , yeah ?
the point is frightening , you make it 's quite easily .
if i example , the tropics , natural numbers , , we need to zero at first , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we would say let 's a copy of this and take from this one copy the infinity many numbers way .
candidates remain just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , ?
okay ?
all along linear numbers are on forever long band of natural numbers , but on a band missing the , on others are the linear and the basics ?
call we have a lot , g , straight numbers , calling us the other sorts civilizations at the natural numbers .
what we believe it ?
is , g powerful , it 's bigger than civilizations , the same size or smaller ?
same size ?
but very , yes , in which is a lack yes .
who have a different estimate away ?
boy ?
who says bigger ?
ah , which has cameras really absolutely no plan , yeah ?
how am also not be , yeah ?
you can am not , where something lacks the larger , this is absolutely not ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
it would you suspect , right ?
this is what you suspected of course wrong .
and now , and now declare myself , why those amounts same data .
what works performed ?
yeah .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the straight lot , we take the zero from the natural lot of couples find out .
the next of zero , after plus two next two , looking at zero hits the one , and i wars again a .
the four , the two , six , the three , eight , the four , yeah ?
you might even reverse if it works doubled , this is clear that ?
and completely clear , through the to do we do that i strap it always in the lecture that 's a .
and this one , there are just straight oldenburg and the band is equally long , yeah ?
we are natural on the linear sequence that 's the way and the band is still same length .
there 's miserable telephone in the infinite .
if you so the reason to explain what we have today learned to have infinity learned , yes , which is because infinite , i know just finally ?
an infinite amount have a property that there 's foyer in rats are not and this trait question is absolute , a real subset of the same as big .
do you in not , if you spend three three people two people , then is just another one up and previously were dismissed three .
yes , so we infinity done .
nobody ?
okay .
then do we still a second part of probability .
the professionals , so dystonia probability .
keep up everything overnight .
at this experiment am i 'm sure , it works least a third know , and it does anybody with the basics has , yeah ?
so , calling us the doors protocell b , c .
i behind anything hidden , i hope you have figured not heard .
and they should now , undercover guess .
where i mean , i was anything hidden behind a b , or c ?
guess , here , our , here .
you appreciate at c .
who has another one another idea ?
c ?
who has yet another idea ?
, b does n't usually hear the am never on the ?
it 's right .
it 's really completely ignorant , so they have n't mean , the three letters will fall and i find me a .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes completely clear , because the chance that they as luck having , well as just at a third .
there are three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now do i 'm following , i just do a way .
well , i know of course , where it lies .
, that has come up here somebody , .
so , i know yes , where it is , and hunting and appreciate or how to wherever you call it comes into a second round .
so i 'm now really straightforward , i now basically now beginning .
it 's so forth , we go into a second round .
now suppose , i 'm on a ?
so now i have a door show up behind the time derartu tulu and they do n't put this very much .
because if you already corresponds to say , and i say , and i know yes , it 's am not behind b .
then cousin 'cause n't second round .
then tell me , , from the mouse , quotes had .
but i have to yes , this is , in the second round to go .
so i can i just a category , behind it 's not only is , but what you could n't put this very much .
now is the question , and dystonia chance , under the condition here remained under the condition , that b open , and it does n't really squared is , they have now their last chance to to guess .
you 're lucky now at a stick , then do i was necessarily a way .
i do now on , what they want .
or you say , i do c , on .
now is the , it is now with this knowledge likely gone ?
, very beautiful , b is on , now know i think it 's behind c .
right now , god bless thanks to b open met , i wanted to always zero g keep it 's what .
or if you now say , but we 've gone so , we 've just another two doors , now is it anyway , to shift or to stay .
what my you ?
it 's no matter .
.
why do n't matter ?
very beautiful .
why is why is it ?
yes , yeah , that 's wrong .
that produces am almost as if we 've heard yesterday would be ?
but that are they 're a new no , fun .
so , a market-based , the thing is quite , yeah .
understand all between you know i do n't , six and yes , i dare n't years of bonus taboo -- i equals not more persuasive that ?
so , please really everyone .
behind this door is to a third .
and it is constantly refers to a third behind a door .
you can guess what you want you 've spent two factors in hands-on .
which means that would you can go on two doors guess , not , you could am at ted evil , you can plug in two dozen put it , then are well , , if you are zero equals , that there 's uh oh , everything in the right life .
but here we 've just a door .
so now is a market-based , two thirds it 's not what you guess .
so is for two thirds here , but it can but just behind a door lie !
behind the is miserable not !
well , what 's going likely ?
senate , i keep beijerinck really hidden !
so , which is now likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or easy lane ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , clearly !
so , this was now not hard to ?
ha !
what we view ?
they have luck had .
why ?
quite simple , even two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between theory and practice .
i hope , it was for any kind of what about .
thank you .
mr. that they felt for the puzzle bookstore here just by bad diet and mercy food and overweight people in beijing , which has this depressed a am totally .
but i kiss my best that later everything again way , those impressions .
i come negative aspect of farm and my aunt zip my 12 was at not a mcdonald works .
this long time for the lesions , yeah .
yes .
thank thanks for the invitation today .
i 'm here in the near grew up .
and i do n't know , whether mr. even justin rna came to me to ask , if i 'm watching ted at sea folk tune and over a particular topic talk today .
i keep my argument implicit faith .
yeah , motivation is also not bad and i 'm the woman on the short circuit might make a or other afterwards more calories .
hat i also full cost too much .
so today night at the rain more jogging , to go to be far too requires , but i have morning in fact train , because i in three weeks on june of , by definition of ann wants to bike -- that 's miles .
walkable i stay morning to watch rain this training do n't .
so who ride want to go tomorrow early go in , i assure you all welcome a .
i keep praying degrees already said , briefly , i carry over the implicit faith .
and i keep praying started , grilled , with the subject .
do n't worry about this nice little , blind faith that came later .
i keep praying before me quick ideas suck done , when i am , how to describe me at greatest where i ?
so , i come from village with six houses , many cases , and at my parents on farm there 's oakland apple apples , and -- and what makes you look , `` beer .
trust , in sports , obviously not in the only in my `` and beer .
why curl ' i the story , where i was a veiled ?
for me is a very important stories that i really like right from the country , from village come ' and there raised me with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the .
and with the second brother , as blind is how much .
it 's called the future bright and dark , who might as i picked also see , where the window in space , whether hundred light on or out .
what today is very convenient is for the .
the , or we both can vibrate see , if protect us anything .
but i was a carrot ' time i ca n't distinguish it 's a man .
but the first subject of the old men , .
still from monterey .
and what for me but still very critical was that 's clearly been the fact , like encyclopedia , you trust and enters picked this great confidence that we all need to be a little situation where danny , i guess .
and that was for my parents definitely , that you how many of them in front of my brother and i still absolutely no blind knew .
we were so the first , then superpowers suddenly , in their lives are .
and then we had them from the do somehow what do .
and now i think it 's a shepherd fortunate that my parents were farmers are not the whole day of time had beside us to stand and focus on the hand to lead or to say : there 's a wall , because you of you tear along and can then feel , where you .
a would be awkward been -- we have come home so .
and b ham , our parents ' first place , we tend encouraged to beat back to go , where it also our sighted brother .
so , in the home alone , and , it also time risk .
there has the blind brother 'm going to farm pushed the tags all .
i was until today still .
so with the big brothers -- who are not only good for the belly is not even for the .
and our brothers , and my brothers and i do we ham on farm wrinkles actually like everything out done , what ma [ silly pictures could , especially interested in for example bike ride .
and that has the brother with passion started with three years , and then inequality we obviously also -- michael and i .
and we then started with to drive , as i used to many little kids today to go .
except that can .
but we even started with the point no .
and then is the big question : how extinctions ma , there ?
and what brainstorming , you trust , horizontal building trust the parents that the children also hotter back from the bicycle and and conversely , trust of us that we 're not permanently , where against drive .
and our solution was that we obviously a of our parents us to tell you 've let 's where are the , so where it represents a car , where radius , where are perhaps even though time advertise things that clear homes -- asks you now , no way -- because we knew , so they are .
and we had between measurable , let 's hand notice , but the hand even listen .
and you can now this nursery unfortunately not all the test , because otherwise it pops up as loud , that they do n't nothing more stereotypical set .
but ' night when you first hundred light delayed and look at her bedroom or in whose bedroom also getting infected dozens want .
you can imagine trying to just with the tongue and so , which has to orient and they 're transferred that 's for us humans as things about bats as well -- they 're a people hear .
so how the bats are like to be even listen , now wall , because the sound acts different threshold .
and this is for me in trust , so trust even in the movement , still very important been .
yet stays high to have and the security , `` i keep praying chance to me crazy tune to help .
and me old-fashioned way to orient no big trouble and clear , even without many accidents , the one or another there were works of course knows .
mathematicians , i uganda today is no pictures over keep praying , i 'm very themselves from a galaxy even when kids .
disability from climb on our higher building on farm .
i keep praying to show wrote `` self-confidence grows as well through a variety .
and my foundation i already quite literally , because i first person feels much too late in and in the way to rely on the science versus busy keep praying , i 'm about one thing about never know , or i 'm never that stumbled out how i swear himself until i .
keep praying , of never as labels maybe even dramatically read .
he but certainly not begin to do that 's obviously not everyone looks exactly what blah nba player .
diversity in our strengths with , to confess to know , where i 'm good , what keep my talent and where can i picked my strengths really too full ?
and our brother acts again , who did michael and i always double-click on the roofs off the house .
so he then put this : okay , we ham here a .
because you could differentiate from the window of the for example .
and that 93 went then , michael afterwards and i keep praying , probably already whenever a little bit like this girl playing `` , you know i do n't .
but last ultimately , who stays like , down ?
so i do n't .
and i dated ' , we are well the generation of young women here , but not .
and of why am i threw then but still with .
and then was painted the consequence that we eventually , all three up sitting at the dad with his followers with and absolutely no longer knew what he now supposed to say rainbow .
because of trust is naturally go away , if other kings .
you know the father so i said , like to god 's sake of help humanitarian aid to get biologic ' the threat relative size been that one of us too afraid whoa bill and in , -- know i do n't -- somehow would .
architectural ' but never happened .
he had to imagine then still so that his secrets acts as well then slowly lost or earring actually has , we then degraded weight .
and finding 'em , i for me naturally great , that we have this opportunity had .
but also clear to do n't worry about this is no principal , not necessary to proceed to do .
for me were the various , in my life more important were all , yes interesting .
and especially interested in they were all for , because i picked also see it could say where keep praying , i like talking about borders , what are perhaps , so my .
so too good would i never be able to .
for i had never the .
and i go trouble until today is n't want in .
i go trouble until today rather out in rain .
now also not at five degrees , like in the moment .
and at rainfall -- but rather than inside his .
but i keep ' time for me like faith in my strengths with discovered that i different variations keep praying .
as first example .
and this was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the coach , of us in had to put this one : ok , we have occurred louder the children , but he filled ' us some blind children .
basically goes well well , because there pack find out anyway each day coats .
and then competitive you know what the other organizations .
and there was still so my big , trust of course , yeah , when i got the long genetics dynamic going to touch underneath , because if anybody else might but guess what do , what i 'm not harm .
so there 'em just a method that , and this is that trust in my claws .
the other grab a foot in the ask me to yourself backwards fall let 's the head shoot and then is it backwards and the 's gone , because joe the full of there .
i pat gloves here is n't test .
i had to me veiled threat .
i dated ' , this is now a little risky .
and for you know i also seeing now , no volunteers ?
.
shit , i kiss before .
okay .
the next for me important was like sports , in school poem when the and natalie .
my parents were home or are until today , and they have us even taught me like kids .
but for me was always in the school wait clear : announcer : how can i stays lot also looking at school friday , to my excess energy rid ?
and because i had then as a way in the school to do .
and although i actually always thought : everything is so fiery a boring , because grass readings for the more ' i .
finding 'em , i used to -- ' i now , no longer .
â™« i then eventually said , `` well , i strap on soils .
and keep praying then picked angry reported that person , again , this is the great diversity here in the sport , because you need to you need power , the r-i-a-a good coordination , and extreme .
; they 've probably a lot also from their work recognized ?
right here 's also in .
you 'll just then quickly , if you poem is full faith in their own technology has .
if you trust in their own exponential has -- so the power to be the rats also then at any kind of conditions , writing bad weather , watching soft snow , watching the snow also on the ski to put can .
and if you in my case acts as trust in the team has .
because when i do n't see , i 'm course , cancerous .
and i 've never sam happens like today -- i got word use -- my -- there were works well just a plane has now almost broke my exercise done .
you know , but nothing , we do you yet again .
diversity , i dated them now maybe just time .
david with a single one of you later still a different practice .
what i tested again snap to watch implicit faith , this is the exercise that i the audience around dick think impressions about it so , if you ca n't look silly to make up with a compass .
watch as well as `` you have two sticks in the hand .
of juliet : yeah , keep praying , i do n't reach more free , otherwise would i am my siblings to take and sculpt the .
is not .
so i have to me different helping .
i keep going my daughters before me running .
and tells me with the voice the route .
so the needs hiring more accurate to do .
and also important for trust .
the precision , in communications , which is the .
and the tells me old-fashioned always , when yochai is that tells me and closer to say , then , left at 11 , then you know i do is easy to the left , so much on top part of rio with .
when he says `` left over 10 bit of the left , and when he says : right on 10 .
okay , all understand ?
then the problem , since then i have again , or he has to me again correct , then you know , i 'm going on every case , now is true that 's not .
and for me is yes , very large , critical , if the before me running , then i have to me , really completely around saturn grabs negative to say .
to mr. uplift to say : he 's for me that tool , i allow the wrinkles actually then quickly to be , and in even faster than others , in the same standard format .
and that can i just , when i alan kay do with both arms me to me , on a leg instead embrace and i have now really the eyes to make -- ha ha -- or can also open wanted to get am nothing .
and have cell acts like and have to get on the other leg and as it back to embrace and allowed this little losses , but has actually stays up to stand .
well with high shoes .
yes , and this is for me very misleading , when i watch i aim : how i swear , the guy to say , so i 'd casually guy , because i actually just men and when we had to how do i figured out aim to say `` hey â™« got me the right fungi , because the clear to see replicate themselves .
the know so i do n't know what he i have to say .
so i 'm pore structure resembles the way to your communications acts open have .
and that 's like in any .
if someone my needs n't know how he me naturally do n't help , but there am i picked asked to have to say `` well , i southern foundation of you the curve probably used to .
or i southern foundation of you see norman watch cycling , that you realize sylvia 's also time , say , how long mating with the mountain climb , because if we the , there thinking , you know eventually time : now has barely gone bust .
and kick microbes all of like and this thing that sounds just not on .
and there southern ' i 'll soon as well first test pilot , like mcdonald watch cycling mean , looking forward , i 'll say , we have unfortunately only 20 minutes behind us , because we may -- so we ham recently seven minutes needed -- then you 're miserable wait yet again prefer .
by puppets is it for me pretty important , there 's also experimental fine-tuned to have .
i confusing exercises -- here there 's mr. gore the other , even slow ?
who provides more ?
so my best of time was a thousand times faster , but this was in september , and now why april , may â™« i swear honest said we 've never so much faster able like .
and at the in the point entirely .
and for me , as i said , are these experimental only then able to when i picked my ear open keep praying .
the other me old-fashioned not exactly explain what he takes you look at me as the ability there , my risk perfect .
and this is for me a very important things why i say `` trust is likely training and not this .
so the cat ] becoming suddenly blind , now , not so much more honest said -- from the .
because i also know that experience was told me a , right and left false had .
and then was in the time bad , because moore along the route three feet .
and i 'm the three feet arrival .
by 1985 -- as i said , that was time -- of course the shadows .
know i also , because we have increased kidney poland , we have so .
and i happened now there permanently , that i people say `` left and say then , `` yes , the other left .
so i was then surely the right , unfortunately .
power in everyday often not so much left .
but yeah , in the situation with pressure , you know , probably also all from the work or the campus like , wherever you miserable time soon move simultaneously .
then of course , precision often lacking any tough challenges .
but for me , as i said , called trust picked up everything that i the risks know have .
and because i have honest say , i 'm when someone who do n't see fairly big in the advantage , because i kiss my risk in ways ways .
so watching ' i now how tough love .
from the driving a tree , from falling down to know i and i ' but obviously -- and this is yes is important -- i belong too good pages .
the detector then eventually achieved going to get , if you trust picked up .
and if you somebody organizing , which has the wrinkles actually also a hundred percent so , as i alan kay need .
and with i particularly interested in both the same goals keep praying .
because this is for me in the implicit faith refrigerator magnets , very misleading .
you need same brilliance and i have wrinkles actually also clear link , which means that it because actually trusting too risks ?
because of times faster term , the you ever used .
i trust , or the sort of nerves themselves .
but this whole truth is yes ! that talk about too much depend .
that you for that you for trust a lot of .
and that you know too -- because we humans , everything with needs -- we want to make sense behind see .
and the sense , which is quite often , that we have rats also create a goal together to achieve .
that we do -- in my case for example -- by some yes , weeks keep praying , i am i went on the gone .
and there 's ' i carefully : i have to me , please anybody looking at the road , i in which case like faith might think that i picked this mountain also up mothers .
and what makes you of going to be on the mountain also hotter really top priority ?
well , yeah , i was obviously the shepherd advantage , i keep praying some things now not instruction , if you dated for example , along with me a hundred meters .
then was me relatively .
can take advantage to get drowned no problem .
and i keep praying wherever it back at the working now , regardless of which i 'm off and to try to keep praying , i 'm going bankrupt fun nor am in berlin flew by showing you 'll with of .
that 's been a little , if you 'll stand up standing and below the car hear , then have you still not even more see , to show up to know , now this does mcdonald hurts when i .
and such things are for me more interesting possession .
yeah , to even the to have but to just as to know , `` hey , i war ' brain while i 'm showing how oh gee , and can just wire , but also emerging new experience much .
and just a little nervous , because at mountain rescue operation works : you go every day 10 hours ago , while and it 's point just plain facts .
you go and go and has just skim stones in order on dysfunction , increasingly less plants .
you take on with gun within front row war gained weight .
so if you see , then is the about the last , the u.s .
but the hat then it 's a branch exciting .
we have the only from the distance seen or another poem .
by thermal ' i got a big , faith in the -- despite his silly , he helped stephen .
because i i thought curse anas : well , so , like iowa because ' i probably speeding away , how far the thing , charging cable .
but as i said , it 's otherwise pretty , because you wait to actually now not so right much change regime .
and really exciting is going to hug when you know anything difficult conversations .
so if you get into the height and the air thinner .
or if moore along a , if you get a little weight , where minutes left and the right .
then going to hug a particularly beautiful and if moore get too . night and love with , then has shown us the early times as well said : now would he i prefer to shore wire take , so he then i also really in the himalayas and in kigali weight .
because i was only without actually and this was hurt if but sometimes to risky .
trust we have so created that i picked put this announcement : well , i can course , my , my friend , the process was a hundred percent trust , i assure you and we 've been good .
but i southern ' even form of security , so i 'm not permanently focus has since : can you think , if you on the mountain perry says , stone , right the right on one left at 11 .
because you 'll someday , and although all .
so for us to trust in the worst prediction , we seek the connection , so ham , we have a wire on your backpack attached , i had in the hand and i get behind her on the grit of wire grades .
we had in the other , that i also make a little bit the height of stairs reported keep praying .
and then eventually only still stuck with the feet of stone kicked or contact with your bucket , that i picked sometimes already knew what so on me to advancing and i 'm not permanently acts focus had .
and what my time calculating really showed me , as beautiful it actually , if you course realized then eventually , because the peak approaches to be picked this goal really so once in near any ancient acts similar as well watch , with the .
hammer it 's but also like that i reported keep praying that trust that i in me to keep praying that grass ' torn up , when i now really goal lawrence academy as i picked up the peak .
but trust is also among other hand , the , like trust acts works .
when we then night picked up the mountain villages were we in the group usually very ahead and behind us are the other seven participants grades and they were always relatively dense behind us and it determines virtually every friday was somebody else behind us and i keep been extremists : clocks ' time , why stay because why vertical because wherever anybody that he got behind us to walk to be ?
night you could also the girls not from behind look .
this is somehow not the reason apparently .
and then keep praying , i eventually herbie , oh yeah ! okay , yeah , their faith in their skills is a facade also hotter pretty .
you go there night by the dark , you go around 12 p.m. go , does go undercover is not light .
this is totally , if you is the air being thin , so basically just another and now , no longer a convenience .
and then came but eventually so the moment , where the cat said have `` oh gee , that was really totally practical , behind you to go , because the friend of mine sent me old-fashioned all explained that we 've constantly -- how women wait is how do .
we all night let anything talked and the other in the group had exactly what actually rats also like the recognition , to know , ok , it 's now just an hour , has to me then talked about .
or i keep them what everyone else , now , absolutely not from the mountain told .
and specifically to know , it 's still swimming up , which may also just lousy about about what we might even talked -- it 's only still hour , the sun is soon on .
yeah these things that even mirrors from outside can trust again significantly increase and can vibrate tend to contribute to be so the personal aim too blurry .
and for me is trust especially interested in then given and especially interested in get perfect , if acts like the personal and what doses i really accomplish want , then eventually even in the idea right there is .
this is inherently clear , in in sports with the gold , where you look like -- know i actually also do n't know why do -- maybe you know , i 'm not going to value to test , or being skeptical , if moore but just zinc , is ?
so i dated award for poo is so , in vancouver to 500 grams hard .
if anything real gold would then i 'm not here , then rescued me on the , supposedly , i .
or at least in the .
but as i said , i dated itâ€™s true stakeholders , why you that make it 's more to be aware of life ca : what keep praying , i actually degrees created and how i was my skills and forces focused on a point .
how to keep praying , i in me in my skills , but obviously in the team , we all need to matter whether in studies , in the job in handy thing to wherever .
anyway , whether old man or young woman who needs we picked people , even in the we trust can .
and if we then this goal in the head clear before eyes have and even reaches have to get the best evidence that we at least in a project in our lives trust could .
and if you moore once you might , you could touch whatever certainly in other domains .
thank god
a science for me , that is the title my topic , the universe is after their port maps .
what am driving , is quite a leash on the sciences again as something in the general population to attach .
in basically 13 i can satisfy be .
if i went into a , there 's miserable time just to the literature to science budgets , the .
even everybody has a range from newspapers , magazines , , where science budgets , issues , somehow through the deliberate action .
everyone abc has least a , where damn science budgets processes are .
even this is totally , if you start attacking , what it of magazines and for children there with science budgets .
every program has somehow uplifting a napkin in , but as a pure story .
science is one thing that can i looked like to gaze that can i want to read , but that affects i am not even .
cool to cool is science just sort at ted , in the bathroom , somewhere , there are the chemical cool ?
in such a five minutes , has anything with the reality to do , but this is cool ?
there , there can tell me transcripts .
big bang , there can i just wrapping laughter , i understand the jokes not , but it 's a terrific .
this is extremely shame .
because this is somehow a little paradox of the future will we just manage to get to hell technological and issues .
but the same bay ; nobody to themselves off .
i keep a few small sample time native , like science , or sciences just for us as a very much .
a simple example : in london got you a nice tower built , , the architect , let 's not so right now , we build this time somehow -- so forth .
what happens is now just that the sunlight from top of these facade falls , i keep the first of syria , which has focused , and then somewhere in other navigation begins with the point .
that went big through the press , there stood crab just a .
shame , the heat impact on the way that this poor , the really long as long did , there are the .
because you ask yourself , as an architect , does n't actually somehow times as a little thing in physics learned , because i mean , am totally fresh , that as a mirror intensely focused .
well , what i found myself , fundamentally redefine who 's kind of before christ , where it soluble by ultraviolet a fleet has .
there question i 'm really , which has the more design or the architect , or where does he studied ?
this is now a simple example .
a classic platforms such current issues , have is also the .
this is now been a few years ago , as far right kind of the media coming .
there was the railroad reservation typeface , because of cereal crops , that was at once a threat .
genes been with green .
genes been somehow what pentagon .
oh , there are gene inside .
there contexts where on the market farmers really gotten used , `` hey , i vegetables .
no idea , which is being should , yeah .
so , yes , okay , potatoes , we can suck debate .
but to the time was i in the laboratory , more active educate and was eventually totally frustrated , because i tried 've got these evil genes in my bacterial cell .
and was totally frustrated that came walking home , and my jogging neighbor , `` yes , you can see but not happy colleagues , which is because you go ?
i like `` yes , i 'm trying since june three days as a little gene inside my bacteria to transform and worked at all right .
this was , what i tried i started explaining , so somehow an genes , i was , yes , enough to the good lady , when i of genes talking to know you know what you have patience .
this was , what i actually meant , so a particular sequence that i sat in these to bring wanted .
but this was , what the woman pure entertainment .
this woman has i never once the hand !
who knows , nigeria , i do ?
genes is something different pentagon .
this is now been well , 10 years ago , and yet has changed somehow in consciousness indefinitely .
genes , this is being wiped out what pentagon .
i was quite long longer read .
it says then always gene technology free and it does n't really in our language of beekeeping .
stunt for europe , was a headline .
which separates into the rooftops of other , corn , maybe even not genes brain .
a different headline to out rats used to die .
yes , that was also a beautiful headline .
these are but not so old and it 's also fairly matter , up ecosystem level , i 'm giants ways .
anyway , whether the time or the picture , all speaking of .
for happiness is still not in katrina , but i 'm afraid that takes too longer length .
but he shares simple , what 's uncertainty in the population swamps , because you just not with the subjects to deal .
we have we in our future us with such technologies engage .
now was right now , nobody had big on the subject , but there are about things angle , chosen the basics of the most no real idea that have .
and this is pretty sad .
how robotics actually at this information from the lab in the population ?
if we take this little boy , grabbing scientists sitting in his lab , has an experiment , gee , beautiful and good , and he thinks you the person , but guess what interests but the public .
then have lesters at the professor go .
the boss , the usda finally , okay , cool topic , throws his name fuck it as , that 's always important in the science , it .
good idea , i 'm still not in the public , it goes on a .
yes , the thinking , oh , super idea , class , actually do we had a .
, because we have a with a project , a nice idea , and coming then sort out from the .
this will then , yes , but at infection really ?
now are like institute rarely go alone , usually have multiple as a collective sputnik , a common .
and from all those are going to the , really cool projects will get over the at the magazine given , at the matter whether it , or are .
this is the way .
of the ground it 's still further harbor , in high metabolic rate really , really cool experiments then , really projects , there in these pyramids .
that 's high-quality high-quality magazine , who are really well done , there 's touch of all have figured free , yes , but that cares mothers i mean ?
in basically basically just look for interest .
in the call we always the .
so , so , anyway already for interest , then the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
beautiful magazine , reached the demographic health care for interest , and maybe about an idea that have , where about it reaches into these articles .
dr. ' i mean , but really ?
the , it anyway interested .
the senate , that was now , yes , the automobile , i call him first gentleman , the extreme conditions other 2007 reading , i 'm trying to it pays them to keep the mothers i mean not really .
anyway , again , our future will we just sort circus to get , if we manage those engaged .
fracking for renewable renewables , , that are all the themes that are , mr. , but not really understand , and over the enemy somehow vote ?
my project , my idea is so , unlike those little boys , which combines scientists out from the to take a really fully by his normal to separate , and he climbed a class to give a seminar and how science through communicate .
what otherwise usually happens to be a scientist so i have a buddy , we know we 've been well , 20 years , he 's , it 's for us a rule , it 's not for his job to ask .
once it 's the mouth and over his career telling it does he us .
, that are scientists to talk to get a price of .
you hear each day , which is already nearly as same level like genes .
and treat this is somehow , oh , you ca n't know , which is behind .
the really teach to pass first on this is beautiful and good , if you on a conference â™« and there on your blackberry , your , on anything to talk want , then you can you want of talk , but pour more time , # but just water lead .
where it 's problem , it really and normal to talk ?
i school so , this is my idea of these young scientist who are still not so far in the hierarchy , are still a little malleable than the school i 'd like you through the argued .
this has for all of a utility like even more investors who want to even know , which there in the happens .
finally , per capita income tax , who are actually used to be so i 've got into actually also to communicate .
but the kind of consultants , that 's just a story .
i want you 'll also really suggested a jury sit and explore your project of life , your project a jury , frankly , worse is miserable not say children .
there is a quote , i do n't know , whether it 's a real , of albert einstein said if you miserable not just explain can then gave you do n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , how can i really peering through communicate ?
so stories are interestingly resistant id .
are totally modern , is everywhere , in place every college , custom , but also where mothers i in basically basically just once the .
who drives because for the end of the city in the university of reason , puts out there was a talk to away ?
that are , it anyway interested .
because i was once myself .
so , that are people out anyway for interest , the path drive and so , there single talks listen .
this is beautiful , there 'll advertise safety shirts , all are satisfied , all are happy , trains came home and this was miserable .
so mockingbird i still having a second aspect to say , it stays there 's not at this of venezuela .
these scientists are too . trained as actually children ?
because many really have to focus on the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children their world explore , is identical .
children working very extreme scientifically .
they do anything like learn to walk .
they try something that works ?
and fall towards the senate , worked not the next iteration , i bothers some parameters , do it more time to .
kids learn extremely scientifically .
that 's really , el , i , what happens , which factors i change has to do that it works or not .
this is normal !
but that have a lot .
and by so i think i really work can only if after collecting and those scientists permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids out of kindergarten , from the grade , portugal together experiments done the kids , on their , and so , there really proud chimpanzees , because i 'm convinced me that the kids and the scientists really in basically 13 indo-european language .
and then you could perhaps , maybe someday , this is so my hope to tell the kids get too home , and then mothers i sometimes mr. , you 'll also reference point for science budgets interested , because the kids to him talk .
this is going wrong somewhere in the newspaper , this is not anywhere in galileo , but his kids to tell him about the mirror to a working memory , that it yet a bread has that there on paper has , and processes get too , shaking then maybe even the head , as an architect as a building machines can .
and not just mothers i 'll course , mr. , but also the .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately it just still remember that the first met mohamed i said , have yes , the senate , so , for our scientists , this is just not subject to have just the other priorities .
a scientist has to know n't communicate can .
yes , i think i realized then , okay , then calls me the next day .
but who somehow miller institute working in a company , like , wherever there are equal to the next break .
thank you .
i 'm really , is the question .
fly you could also not every day .
the last weeks were terrible .
the weather control us a big painted by the bill did .
imagine seven , soon eight years i 'm asking met , if i 'm here 's responsibility today .
i had been ceo , almost 10 years , at in and in .
we 're actually quite far came up coming .
expressed as a client .
and for me was actually rather , well , this is yet .
what should really ?
this is really naive .
i keep going n't know learned who rat backpack , and why am i now here .
and well maybe it 's a little crazy , but it 's on every case too high emotionally .
it 's beautiful and more exciting and make the great fun .
and i 'll give just in the next few minutes a little out of this life , one story .
i 'm ceo basically .
the company there 's been a hundred and years .
i 'm ceo of .
this company there 's been 20 years .
and ceo of .
the company , there are known about or years .
who runs over here at .
.
a picture , i 'm here show you want to the little spot right , this is actually like a sputnik , as an offensive or anything to do n't know , you know exactly this point is still too big .
there 's rule globally , all .
and those are actually simply overwhelming even 10 active .
this shows know what .
there are around 20 thousand active worldwide .
so this is really absolutely no market .
this is also not even a .
this is a , a .
and the question is also , `` why does you get really ?
how about anything ?
in translating and only 10 active , because we can assess still point about talking about why it 's .
very quickly to history .
having a couple of many really dietrich this company .
very little .
one percent of fourteen years after the first war around the launched .
then buried in the first war , died way , and collected 20,000 built for .
we then london protons and so forth and so forth .
and when we and eight folds london lawsuits are , and with a great there 's a campaign to fly , both english newspapers , filled with the headline said this time they come , but not to bombs , but in a peaceful intent .
so much has the story because all of a .
and we had a metaphor campaign .
but the client was n't seem quite pleased , because he suddenly realized gotten , which got left behind apparently , what 's old memory there inside environment .
and processor that was wait for a little critical .
but it was in london a good campaign except the weather in north showing up was proposed many years been very bad and very .
and we 're not very much flown .
then one of decades , hugo has taken .
and has a , if north america delivered by .
this has a myth 1968 , the whole german nation amazon has been something felt , which has got enzymes and violently raped .
there was going up in new york welcomed with .
and the whole german nation 's the caves has , we have been fired .
that stands in all goes inside and this is really explain a little to that myth by this device .
but actually are going to this and just five , six , seven at even built were and basically just two really big , and the , the passengers carries have .
passengers a hundred , where oxygen passengers , they were the end .
it was but a myth .
and then back was the first broadcast accident rate showing as well unfortunately yes .
along the titanic that any time , where it 's an icon of a a product and then also never more after flight .
but the different devices were posted .
and , the last remaining temperate destroyed .
the materials used for , mineral resources .
then was a long no 72 years .
and then the had the and , who had the idea , probably should you once it starts .
and i was recruited , because you pit technically a teenager product built , which has come we same contrast , but the market .
yes , he reaches a market ?
what 's because actually go ?
so .
about theme we now .
the , this is perhaps more quickly to explain that we ham yes timeline about it again , , people have a lot able to .
there are many companies that out of this arose are .
there are today employees , around 20 billion revenue .
this is a right , high profitable .
there behind a lot behind .
so much i 'll also believe that this came up to come .
the itself is actually a completely normal plane as each other plane as well , but any excuse to have a gas , the helium 's not mimic and also a with .
is like a whale , the ocean water on and beneath the maths , and there to do have .
the time is now n't there , in detail to explain .
lit see a way out , with a structure .
there are two varieties of .
there 's rigid , we are in which case , and .
we lit no structure and they 're touching weather balloons up .
that 's the most , in the world thames tunnel is , around the piece .
and dreaming there 's only today , how much earlier , he said , only still fundamentally redefine minus to our own traction , so around just last decades .
so see if the production from , if one here raised by .
left the structure yet again .
and here 's also .
comes from the .
ela : the astronauts .
then there are the origins .
10th one gifts two million euros was like a shell .
and it has to make it must be , and must also be , because over again have you know skeptical that when times a crack chicken farmer , or a hole , that it 's not more . secondary prevention .
actually do the microbes do and infant lock , if we going on holes controls .
and the end looks a without the way out how it there is .
so technically a product
and see you here , down at the numbers , very short time .
one gifts to nine percent , one gifts to nine percent , one gifts six four percent , which means of thousands thousand in about falling might look .
this is very much drama and very very good .
this is a .
can you see muscles .
but there 's another one trend , we 're now anxiety does and the have i show up roughness .
we had before three years , percent , when i started i years ago , five years ago eight years , percent and last year percent or .
and this year in may were we at percent .
if you are eight years , talking about eight years , in and learn derive want , if you could say at least in these eight years of course , a the , also clear , in these eight years has changed the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're .
we can actually passengers also not through some fog fly .
want foie gras yellow .
and the or rise actually every year gradual decline .
so a little yeast , that our weather changes not just felt the downsides as well statistically , because we do a weather every day changes .
but because it 's this is now , well , has to subsidize a program to do , almost 10 million euros , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i come morning right from finland .
here is equipped them , is a flying lab gotten .
it 's called the campaign .
and we have done in the from wells and feet .
it 's called .
and the t flies by italy to this pathway after finland in a .
over many many hundreds of measuring the and analyzed the air out how to remember , how they react on our things that we ultimately grounded do .
there , so i was just declared , showing up we are just with the second .
a teenager an environmentally assignment .
and if you so want concrete from the subject weather .
this direction so very good .
and here 's never even some .
over sweden last week or a week .
and in finland is the way the weather super , degrees , '96 degrees .
the say that something they had never .
i figured i there just wonderful beauty warm days until .
that epidemics were then also absolutely not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to de as a diamond looking for better put this volcanoes of looking at the are the propeller pairs by through a million years .
only can find each other questions , is everything is africa , then a , if you for the sense , asking for an idea , asking for the literal question is a sense when the same time in cinema back the movie or 19 .
because i 'm always wondered , well what do we got really ?
and what support we got really ?
the end of both we after two years , then also done .
the went then also not continue .
the entire came back and this project was then finished .
and a tornado has the end mast go back so broken , he even edinburgh , down absorbs storm .
was but not so bad .
we had actually quite nice insurance , they were actually quite happy .
this was missed the prototype .
and i knew nothing not what i mean to make should .
yes , what we now make a very quick lesson from the .
what we now make it goes much biomass in order to go about complexity , it comes to ask , growth or heads .
what we now do is the here in .
we do of course .
we we need to the still alive .
it 's called .
there are am still too socket inside , after 10 to fifteen 've been replaced will need .
we replace just the entire for nearly five million euros .
there with consumers about theme we still .
we do we need to the constantly doing .
we are the military fighters and warehouse , the most of the germans and of the european undertaken controlled trials , again , and flaws , with as well , or as well .
this is also and costs money and have always on also get eaten .
the question is makes you actually more ?
want you keep innovating ?
makes you bigger ?
there , .
what makes you got really ?
okay , you keep in the market ?
okay , you keep in the fraud ?
and we 've obviously in my time as fixing .
and because we 've also others suffered .
same way too few sustained has and repeatedly broke it was .
at early on the stood still the donations from .
the population of the german population has it back then rescued by six million as a donation , as the fourth goods and he 's in basically broke it was having the population him a donation done .
and learn is at the and the other companies born , otherwise we or i today anyway not here and also other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , .
we were , and you hear past , in san francisco to a client .
behind stuck a very .
both projects are afraid failed .
so well .
the same time we 've won .
because i 'm not a picture lead , because we still not show you can .
but just in america is now the of the first in most done properly .
we have three piece of 2001 .
affordable interfaces we like a with a partner while the technology to .
and this is a great success , but the same time to defeat arrival .
two customers are in basically founded because it 's not collapse .
why went to do n't ?
we know it actually gone .
either was the location not the right or the passengers had to cold or in america know knew how the last thirty forty years , the advertising did have .
the ham and people have to have seen , they said , `` yes , once a , once a , the naive advertising .
there anybody who knew nothing could n't be there might .
and it was basically double difficult in marketing is the lollipop to get `` hey , people calls on and trap .
walks proudly .
the pilot transported in the transport , welcome to passengers .
but last year we 've only able because weather .
actually missing something similar even a half million .
this is going poorly .
the flying routes here .
it 's the sense of course , beautiful , when i also as ceo 'll see how the passengers , and , all laughing and we in basically also not advertising to do , because it 's mouth to mouth is and always urges us about sold have and people say , this is so beautiful , and recommend it their friends , known to whom should still further , in the family .
and we 're awesome .
whereas i always been have to the failure to be thinking , we 're .
you could still more sub-orbital flights .
we have such a day and we 're authentic .
this is true actually also not quite .
we do not advertising .
this is times a have been done .
and has made up with the island , together .
but the is a harder market .
and you must feel sometimes even the question : make the advertising more sense ?
we have am really enough ads , but the internet has a lot of changing the over the launch a while , because all the control .
the is largely , therefore , there are today crows still 10 active in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one cardboard , three has bought , 10 are actively .
so are then six of 10 .
which means we 're going to the market selling , if it at one is to control .
and hope that soup also been a future neurons being able to .
and what on to finish david scott , commander of the apollo fifteen to reach its paris and five , he has said , `` sex walkable lectures lancet fluke .
so beautiful .
advertising to do find we even beautiful .
just find that we have any customers .
to do find we love , has a technological value .
because we customers .
this is no sensations .
it 's going on and away .
so one such a takes years until you the maggots .
and then there is going back few years , no .
because there is too funny effect of the easy for and hard to control are .
on every case is the situation , , a point in , so basically no market .
anyway do we continue .
it 's an icon of the region .
the have the power to do .
you ask yourself , all right now , the question of adolescent form do we continue ?
how much money give us in the ?
what do what do we chose this ?
in the adolescent form should run be ?
and i personally , they did i also asked , some personal to say , i 'm course , along with my employers to places where i wanted to go back against the big , nor having a little dead step want to go even here to rescue .
i was also some point for greenpeace three years , when i went through vancouver island risks am and those around the jungle seen 've got me so , i 'm there ai hire let .
and then there was a about greenpeace , in the money notion that are and never knew what you start making trade-offs and almost to talk about to essentially gone are .
because they have me to employ to survive to .
and i have three years long greenpeace welcomed as and now do i 'm here in the hope , a long future in to achieve .
zero , true ? forty seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .

yes , thanks .
that 's my three points that i 'm in the minutes rotterdam want .
why we are today in or in excess ?
how come forward to ?
and especially interested , what do ?
what what is miserable because triangles ?
beginning we manage our initial point .
the first part is probably a little depressing .
but it comes to whatever billions of the challenges to show .
a few years ago hat ' even harder been sort of explaining .
that we have a problem have today , you know every child .
that we environmental impact .
but it 's worth spreading 've always keeps falling asleep , that 's the challenges that growth for example .
all sorts of these exponential temperature .
if you time in a historical long term look at the for example , then becomes a very short episode in history have been to be .
in prevention can we do n't think that somehow differently about , when that always been moving container .
you know the climate change the last few years .
some say , yeah yeah , historically there was time , look we the last few years on .
you could also look at the ' i also right .
you can also say , who needs because glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it comes to get worse , if you look at a little deeper so busy to sort of real challenge to make things that it really to avoid true , otherwise we 've just trouble at , in the health .
it 's called it up days over thirty degrees .
and there is rising costs degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or a kind of becoming increasingly more kind of bad .
it comes but also to the , especially interested in asia .
think about the himalayas , where the great streams drawings and the them depend that there continuously water from which comes .
it goes past ultimately not to the planet .
the planet is what we do , because there was pretty much larger crisis .
and , but it goes around us to the people , the kind of africa into an altered ecosystems are very lives are .
it goes around the loss of biodiversity .
the deserts temes spreading out .
this becomes increasingly less .
this is the aral sea level , where an essential part of our cotton heritage .
and everything , where come forth ?
this whole gay things , # ' i woke up hanging in one or another form with the global truce .
with what we collectively from the planet partners , what we harvest .
not just the oil and the metals out of minerals , not even those renewables resources are kooks , but last ultimately scarce .
and we should just look at that we so low as possible to consume less , to also last legitimacy is less waste and emissions to produce .
it is so why is in the already told met the whole really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , attributed smiles , of a car on a transistor is not really differently to live .
different to economies .
our technology completely new to change .
if we still time short spiral of hunters and the grasslands , and there are still on the planet societies , basically like life , come with a ton resources in per person , and 2004 left .
in a were then in the longest time the human history of three hours , five tons .
there are now it fifteen percent .
so he does this .
and he 's very much unequal greener on the planet .
it 's in north even more than at us at us even more than for the earth unsustainable .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa 's very much less .
and methane coming , we are rooted in the implications for us , the rivers , the air is much better gotten over the last decades , but it lies in basically talk about that we in other parts of the world has shifted have .
and the other parts of the world grow up , but still less favor .
and jump ahead also the conflict , we see , of grass , afghanistan , where more pollen look at the of american survey and then you see , where the resources colorado .
and this is there is david particularly colorful , which means that there are many resources where , where the world are .
so if we donâ€™t want to get to have we with the subject to deal .
so we need to us to change the ecological limits are everywhere , which is everywhere .
and what we here at life have is that 's not .
he said mahatma gandhi daughters as he said , which has the world has enough for aliens needs , but not true aliens greed .
and there are we , as we here in the average life been inappropriate suck .
so .
this was the virtual worlds .
but i think always be the needs to understand it 's worth caring even though , what to change .
even when i later tell would be worth caring even as such as opposed to live , absorbs more .
but it 's but constantly swimming upright , from the takes you but one of grounds , # ' i guess .
so , which is actually ?
and there have we requested that we in our 'm sharing the world , so much achieve very much economically , astounding amount quality of a standard still focused on average often n't do n't qatar .
here 's quite a playful mood , but there are people , and you know certain other people who are absolutely not so good deal can with this story .
i whistled even wrote , there .
and climate have the same cause .
we work too much and making bows .
this is on one page views we ourselves in distress , and eventually it 's too much .
i work too far apart .
and on the other side cause we coupled these .
what but then a good life ?
how we define ?
now emerging kind of a a small scientific .
well , what i 've been told myself and what i later tell 'm going to scientifically kind of , but here is it comes alan kay drum , how can i kind of arose once defined ?
and there 's important to understand quality control over two aspects .
quality control the aspect of the objective conditions as i 'm going to what i 'm going to eat breakfast .
keep me a roof over the head ?
keep my friends ?
keep my relationship , can i end of life participate ?
but acts as well , how to go to hug me so , how to go `` i sculpt with oil ?
i assure that sometimes the quality .
and then ' i two notions constitution at the place important are .
one needs .
the needs are quite fundamental dimension in our human development , ours , there is rising costs drum , to feelings .
if we our needs wives can then we are happy .
and needs you could n't say , needs are maintained or not sustainable .
needs definition se run viruses ca n't cry .
what 's needs ?
you could various researchers quote , i keep up just two called .
and showing you see of course the physical needs , but also shed for the security , for social relations .
seeking protection for participation , looking for creativity , for the spirituality for freedom .
it has a little thing with money to do .
but to a major part wrinkles actually not yet , but the question is , how can i 'm in my life zones .
and because i 'm at the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy that i balloons up to me to freely available to me that needs to fill .
and there is rising costs 'll already billions of that can i kind with a high road with a low do .
there can i much money needs or a little money need .
strategies that are picked my behavior as i told my needs .
this has to my values to do with the resources , with the ways that i 've .
if i was a little money told pat ' i different my needs trying to satisfy it as if i kind of much money on account i .
it comes initially to the , that 's the roof over the head , to eat , and then sort of around the .
and here comes to hug when drum , can with a lot more or a little , that can kind of sustainable either it .
and if we all strategies to me to freely available to my needs to satisfy you 'll talk , we of a lifestyle .
so .
this was the kind of scientific .
and now go unregulated billions of what we can now do ?
how about december like about this ?
and there simply just some evidence .
obviously has sort of whatever anybody to replicate themselves find .
but the evidence on the individual one species on a technological way , here is supposedly ' i was fortunate also about engineering firm founded , and finally too on a political blogosphere .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what do we ?
so , where you want we go ?
the slides along start having kind of said , the threat is that we kind of cancer still further consumption still more resources consume .
last alter the quality once in bandages because even the effects continue ignoring gets kind of , and on us last ultimately back and nobody will .
or whether we do , sort because in a different way to go up with less , maybe even with less consumption , but with a higher quality is how linked data .
because there 's oakland a career may recognize him some of this topic , so higher quality with less .
there is supposedly a lot about technology how can i every single thing that we here we use the computer , the juice , the coffee is driving , the traffic , how can i like that produce ?
cement that can i now else altogether , i can building from wood build , etc. dislike .
in order to significantly less than or the same quality to create .
my other teachers who has so nicely on the per , and there are we at the water , which today is too long time discussed was met , there is rising costs very deeply back on hundred companies to look .
where are actually needs ?
what 's services can i really satisfy ?
and how can i contacted investigative little do ?
and although not to a little bit less will not with , percent less .
because there are many examples of this kind of been able to .
in vienna should have a tower built going to decades .
with seven is it in already built .
in the default out of wood made .
you , if you might in fifty years longer takes structural can and then once in his bits and not appreciated , so kind of very much less resources consumed with everything else along comes you there kind of in the moment with a half of the goal is to a fifth of , over the whole lifetime of the house thought about this one fifth of a long enough .
it comes but also a lot in our own kind of like ' i 'm really ?
elena montrasio has a nice book written by .
where he shows how hard it last legitimacy is kind of really from the left the kind of like this foragers .
the , i want to me to sort shuttle the other come home , and then i 'm sort of eternity in this in this race inside .
if weâ€™re having a kind of britannica , â™« i quickly admitted , and then you hug ' i the new .
most beautifully ' i know you all .
when i seti institute founded keep several years ago we have more letter writing .
then once you kind of waiting to get until the letter recover , now write `` i r-i-a-a email , is the r-i-a-a ?
for write `` i hundreds emails .
and i can be very much longer afford .
this is productivity growth , we get equally obsessed back .
but i ai n't really time .
i keep for me about done .
there but good examples of slow grocery example , where i really kind of the claim the quality and the cycles of in the foreground place .
and with a low over mothers do .
one mine is .
there are skeptical today you have chairs , that the r-i-a-a average person at us in germany , austrian about 10,000 things in iceland has .
you can even starts to count .
who shares two , three generations , tens things that was having employees , the staff .
so much of us who manages .
we 've got ourselves with .
and getting fewer people come with it clear , with this all options .
and we need a toddler , of us about helping us to help with those few things .
hat ' dated ' i was interesting is probably too . r-i-a-a projection from the spacecraft actually go out , supposedly ' i also not getting tens things out .
the next example is use instead have .
an oldenburg boom .
star , , he feels kind of perhaps above 20 years , somehow , in alternative circles built met .
in the meantime use it still more people , if you start thinking .
if you start thinking .
flare which models are just start working , how can find the things that we already have these beautiful here , imagine a few hundred years , built was still kind of use and more about the squid centuries without using tape is performed last useless .
what even invested was just better to use .
this is the last ultimately also a question of justice .
i keep them been shown kind of how unequal that 's take them as an image from africa and europe and one 's ecologically world .
it kind of like that all the same with these resources families can only when possible , if we were significantly less glucose .
and that 's called dick 's not less quality , because many of us as soon it kind of it too much .
but it 's an important job market economy , the company , these products , those services actually ultimately provide places that we need to us a good life to do with significantly less resources .
recently aspect of this has also something with the great politics to do after the growth , ' i guess .
if you a little attention to the projections to read , then is a facade been many oecd , , now , every week are these projections been looking down .
it means , yes , a crisis stands up the door for my view , and even after , what we kind of very much with some economists talked yesterday , and so busy , have here are the numbers for austria , you find this kindergarten for all countries to go to just went down .
and there 's no reason then growth to have , so , such as i left my youth , from the years know .
first part has all of a mathematical reasons .
one gifts , five percent growth is now , so much like eight percent growth before fifty years .
and eight percent of what china today has .
these are also about there , where we might imagine fifty years were .
total , if the pie bigger , kicking harder more times eight percent .
one percent is still much , so that are we extended families .
but you must remember sort of bending adjust that means that 's not even if we zero percent growth would like trusting that yes , in the next year precisely such a lot of producing and consume and income so much like in this year .
we can well , invest and so we can work .
this is also junior assistant 's not like herbie , because you these statistics know , the show that 's a ct scanner early days ' no longer with the quality together .
the economy grows , but the quality stay in developing countries about on the state , on we are .
and the way as jobs are even without growth happen and it depends not not so deeply tied to how we always been of and how you all welcome mozart is going .
this is true just not and then have to get into the same time with the economics to deal .
and it comes over again and more frequently , that you the same way that format , or the next week , supposedly ' i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this subject to start critique .
already has changed edward , jogging nobel in its trajectory that he said , which has a good life the good economics , sex murder ball hits index second .
why is performed last legitimacy and not to not primarily in order to do not primarily to grow to do what to our countries absolutely no longer walk .
for border , like countries , even for china , for india there 's the r-i-a-a â™« another story .
and this is going on the only then date also below , if we there kind of fish grow grains and we just sort of on this level , on this high levels on we 're good to keep life and economies .
generation needs hug both politics .
it takes goals .
it takes divorced , say that economists .
it takes not just sort of growth , but we should really pollen , and measure and ask , like david perry supposed to the quality , rises up on ?
the 12 ?
after also our politicians measure .
of course , as high school ?
how about this kind of together ?
we need a substantial aspect instead of the finally to tax , and not work .
who of them particularly of entrepreneurship among them , but also know very good .
what kind of control , you know what we at times a colleague , paid 4,000 .
that could you very different experiences .
the resources belong kind of reduces and myself among the resources and not work .
and you have the last ultimately all the analog to unacceptable to create in order to , health , infrastructure without growth .
okay , but there have you remember sort of a little sarah .
which means that conclusion , more or less on all levels can in this way working properly , we can we understandable , we can be companies are right products , services as a consumer sort of us questions , what needs we actually , how do that we do what 's kind of good for us ?
what needs we and what needs we may not ?
the right political choice , the framework exploitation .
some evidence â™« i gave them .
and last incapable of course also the science percent is still in the way , how we can grow boost ?
he but unfortunately nobody able to .
if you the projections look if you the progress look at the last 20 years , it is always looking down because it does n't go .
the politics creates lack of the does n't grow to do , but this is the question how to go forward to the oil , and structured way that we have a good life outcomes have ?
so , mcdonald alongside ooh .
giants young adults , ooh lake .
with heart , the brain , hand , and the last ultimately also the are we add function .
thank you .
i am .
and i love this city .
this city has many stories to talk .
a result has opened up a few hundred years , biomimicry .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving although i equals , and on the story of a little bit later .
you 're going to do have to the egypt .
this is the r-i-a-a , here in the middle of this city manager , and a lot of this city even soluble and .
a different story before .
it was at a hot across nevada .
a man interval , like at once in his shoes and so right that it right .
that him to warm .
he 's the europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
it makes cambridge hospital he pulls the shoe from taking a knife also not long bite all , and although several you know where lots of holes all .
he pulls the shoe been tied behind his knife to leave and funerals , he has a new climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , breathing , born .
and this number , you see here is the place in the at the super now interdependent .
a company emerged with four letters .
the one or other of you know it .
he does the original idea fact , nike and offered .
both have been rejected .
so says he said , well , , i strap my own business .
about it at the stock .
erick now several thousand employees in 360 stores , across industrialized world .
so much for the subject creative problem-solving .
why not something new realities , which still not there is ?
and super motivated people might ask questions come up with out .
if you still do n't know , it stands for what 's an opportunity ?
this question that has i 've often helped in difficult situations .
if something wrong grades or my me or technology works n't do whatever .
a little memory , .
what 's an opportunity ?
and while yves rossy takes off into the .
what difference can ' i do with this example here illustrate .
and one another example of divinity within the dictator , and although the endurance of .
and the proof , like creative people to be able to move around their own insurance wo .
i want to give a few examples here show .
these are so in fact that aesthetic at and the iphone app also a did .
i prefer the right ?
my son has the woman 's not .
he 's just about the woman from the .
or i had the whole day plants as i the intersection reached that grew suddenly a bush in my appears and i could other vehicles longer to see .
quite clear , who do this guilt is that ?
the bush .
the are .
i 'm not been and two times almost died .
because you can i mean least half of immediate .
the last i was at the crash n't blame .
debt was the young woman in .
if you a man who are , each other statement obsolete .
if you but a woman who are to understand it anyway n't .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish me and i dream them , that we all over by this creativity use .
many of us are in a .
and have n't like to be .
why not exercising enough time different do ?
old stuff that we do , the opportunity routine become ubiquitous , we may already bored , or , as opposite .
why not just ever intended to make a , as a little simple .
and there are performed so companies use .
for example , who have yet these of their clusters are these signs , or at the wall , for example , and actually says then maybe so what brainstorming .
well , an opportunity ?
let the coffee to stay rather severely .
or so what .
we have no , you .
well today knows ?
if you dip there 's not burnt tap can .
or eat at me , otherwise starvation , we both .
but creative .
so something needs works .
i get biologic ' one of the client or if you would and say , okay , liked me .
' i left .
an ant in the most recent , and flexibility in .
once the coach ever the current news to review policy .
if you cooking times on the was , you .
even got the main complaint about too long , frozen food .
it 's a building and this restaurant very small , so i had the chefs all the hands fully to do .
it was too deeply .
we educate coming together , what do we ?
how to solve our problem ?
we can not faster elsewhere in the kitchen .
following idea is born .
on every desk being a hypothesis fresh , salt , pepper , and a .
so that at the in the agonizing on december eat your long time itself could .
ten times differently .
a creative commons , and maybe even with the dietrich .
there is a person who makes you the currently not particularly popular .
this person is the leader of , so , the .
and historically , yes , the german curved .
already the second day , that takes more monday , so four days .
a company has for the staff of the month chosen , and technological probably already , which .
a says , rather , we thank you .
the people come to us zipcar ?
the buses that are full of it 's powered by being slaughtered itself in coordinated because each of course , after another because seeking out of b for the b to come .
but why do n't even though probability of something practical and creatively from his disadvantage of something like to do ?
sometimes happens scientific creativity also .
and it comes from a may 2007 , like at this company , you may know .
so we know 1998 , that 's where at n't really good about , but that look at the too ! save need is , but something .
or watching in the car .
there know we know the various , and all possible directions .
yes .
why does n't a piece of race car bedroom , if you physically ?
or at there hug both ways , the creative people to shape .
and all that has to do just with humor , with joy , with sometimes it 's stupid ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my son in my in office .
and sitting on this before me .
so , we have multiple around the .
and then turning it from left after the right , has his joy , and i in my databases of clocks ' point where you very confusing in this is am not a playground here .
he to me , looking me at the big eyes but the playground .
and in the moment , `` i 'm really does it right ?
why is not a playground ?
why is what we do n't the playground for adults ?
this hat ' but much ?
if we innovators who are , if we our talents use to do this , what we like to do .
and make breakthroughs , but the top innovators .
this is that , when a emit day of the week coming then distributes itself what in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week and somehow 's our focus on a other day .
so another one day we usually prefer ?
so in the way weekend .
hear you know too early on the media .
most of meaning besides funny , just another day basis for the weekend .
or if then the shephelah time of the year we announced that will be the vacation .
what are going to the rest of weeks of the year ?
it is that dreadful ?
we have all so awful jobs ?
a had multiplied on the cover given this topic .
yes , monday boys ' i and the rest of life , you ask ourselves .
or based on facebook , anywhere in the social networks gets tricky topic reformers .
let me through the , one of the in .
there 's oakland a lot of business and i cousin told the periodic table .
what did the way in the , which there 's miserable because it ?
and one day i 'm going to this business with this scenario to buy .
and the first sign , you see here , yes , well actually quite nicely .
so , of tools like love to do instead to work .
i am also , gay father of five children , but i love also my work overwhelming .
yes .
or a quiet institute 's a sign .
why its own attitude , increased 300 degrees manifest , and significantly more frequently and still further .
somebody has 30,000 times as an answer to this way posted it 's not on monday , it 's painted the job .
and i question actually effectively with the pink glasses , this forward to go and say , okay , jazz musician time .
what about my job is beautiful ?
this silly , even when they curl the pink glasses , it looks all the same look like before .
so something nice to talk , not nice to work obviously not .
the pink glasses , is the way super danish bike ride .
there holding a beautiful flying away , who else in the eye land would .
but to do n't .
where lead us , if we do n't change ?
actually the job , the content , our ?
within the company , manufactured as .
it ends maybe in a system where we like governor of us feel like the mouse .
the mouse rises a in this and forwards and forwards and running , and eventually it works too fast , this that it caught the poor mouse and they tips out .
what makes the mouse , but ?
you know as well nothing else , you go back at all in .
and again and perhaps the movie day know you might least gets you know soft .
this is beautiful here with hay , so sorry , yes , there and it comes over and always been so back .
and what we as funny feel probably has the mouse eventually some point concussion , yeah ?
or outlet needs yes , that .
i went minutes ago years and so when i was ibm came from a seminar went home .
and on suddenly turned around and so the street under i felt it was entirely african-american candidate my eyes and somehow got 'em my youngest nationally .
at next day went i first doctor , because i 'm thinking , which is actually go ?
he traces me and said , the senate , is physically , everything in order .
but how looking touch with from ?
and i looked in my calendar , in order to check , and saw , i worked three weeks from and somehow i also the job .
after 20 years in the and collaborator , as first in the early been wondering whether we at night used to finish make .
â™« i also thought , which there beijerinck really otherwise seen for jobs ?
and keep started to , then other priorities to sit down to look at that i think back with my family ' , something good for me to themselves desperation .
' , whether or mcdonald 's not r-i-a-a other stars in my job , a new divine .
i keep herbie , the talks confronting large groups to make me really joyful .
i strap ' home as imagine computer and and also other things , but these talks impulses going to declare that experience exchange , who prepare me really joyful .
and this was n't always whistling .
i keep ourselves realize have that this stress sick you know .
and sometimes need beijerinck really this before the rudder so , of my degrees back from the hospital released met after he 's an attack had changed and on even starts he also at the .
sooner than i said , `` johnny with some jogging , he sees me constantly , yes , you to remove walk and so .
today about it themselves .
so forth , with a beautiful slow , in the right , but eventually are we also wicked jogging go .
what happens ?
in ultimately will we all carbs .
go down , but a curve , and expands , these disorders because of marital health .
minus four percent in the last 10 years , almost minus fifty percent of this is beautiful , becomes less .
rise of psychiatric disorders plus percent .
this is something , where i 'm thinking , have this is how to be ?
why is why ?
it 's just in austria as ?
no , even in germany , it works .
, that 's all carbs .
this is so here on the left-hand side to discover .
top down psychiatric disorders almost plus a hundred percent within the last 10 years , finds a a big german out .
the number of takes too .
but the cost .
and caregiving itself all sorts official , what we can do with this topic ?
conservatives tend suggestions sometimes jokes also learn how do for example here .
so good measurement it .
and somebody has ever said , no alcohol is also is no solution .
but what 's going to the solution ?
what 's going to what we already been healthy power and fulfilling and with joy get ?
and having me the last few years , busy .
i keep bailout , there 's towel looks something like to be summarized as something even be ?
i am , the job is n't know what we soul and happy to do ?
there are many other things , most important are the family , health , think , etc .
but the fact is yet , that we put the biggest part of our in the work spend .
and if you do this , why then not how do that we do joy aims and even smell different .
the ' i 'll define as last 'll offer is how to and swine flu .
these little texts , you look around and hopefully go easier resistant .
stands for talent manifestation of freedom and environment .
which means , like ' i mean talents ?
in a communal environment jazz musician , i also with whom ?
what 's freedom keep praying , i 'm here , to do , what i do want ?
because the degree of the us .
more convinced , more stress .
and what david , i learn ?
the actual execution .
for are these four areas .
and it can everyone to replicate themselves check .
i had to me to themselves check before few years and i strap undoubtedly will always been .
can i mean talents memories ?
in a communal environment ?
and which means , sometimes go i in a shop with my laptop , to princeton prepare or a .
the freedom .
what 's freedom that can tell me take to do , what i important .
and please , i screwed anyway ?
the actual execution .
the last u ''
and then there 's miserable time once people to me explain why do n't go .
and why is where you a lot harder .
then figured i usually very official , an answer on this place .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't have reasons .
and lamp at the place you could you the indian ' i ways to hug ' i ways maybe keep praying , i reason ?
and they 're in two pretty much .
what do we so with our ?
each of you has its large instruction .
yes much too small .
that 's filled with , using gold , with everything possible , with their skills .
what do we learn ?
lamp for the question we .
or if we in hospital lying or end one of life .
what keep me with my experience ?
incidentally , who here livelihood levels on to be like to assess this was still access .
well , what do we manage our , is so my first question , also reminded me to themselves , and although every day .
' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
i talk wanted to talk .
and ' i think of nowhere else do .
these egypt was saving for the first years ago , enemies came .
and the enemies rhetoric that kind of homosexuality as well , built was that you 're not pharmaceutical could .
thick walls of ways to egypt , thick doors found out repeatedly .
was time .
so i thought at the following , okay if we do n't be waking up resistance against us a .
we let there 's no longer out and all .
first watch how long mating , there endurance .
the newspaper from a long until the day come , where the bacteria uses photographs .
they had just another one was already on the path led to be as the on some point for the says , of lentils to me in these and input for me three days .
okay , ' ass â™« i assure you come to invade the and us .
comes with a way .
at once look down the enemies , how about the wall of assault just a pulled it led by over again from left after the right and already in the early .
well , thinking into a , which is already .
it 's a poison .
then becomes a up on the wall of assault , toast is he but black .
enemies think differently , oh , who has another two boys ' even something forever .
at night the same scenario more time , toast is he knows the , there on and starving refugee â™« .
the end of the second day after six different reproductive choices , down moved into a away .
because you thought , that takes us too long talks we ourselves longer valid .
after that went down to and the .
the one of the they had and the you have .
frogs are the universe .
i liked this idea that all right there 's what we need , and that we all have .
sometimes have responsibilities resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it is low .
but also so we can but something to do .
we have no idea of the power , we have the world day to to invent .
and if you believe that could now a good , to then they have right .
in the spring comes the spring .
the next .
and we go to know , there disappears at the snow , there 's going to touch warm up starting to the plants at of branches brown to green to be .
actually come blooms eventually emerge from those blooms fruits .
actually come apples here 's very popular we then harvest and eat .
because there 's grain of this grain could we 'll put bread baking .
because there 's exploding lions eat .
because there 's barbecue being , then the products acts learn after lunch .
and it happens automatically .
if you ca n't think about that may not not so nowadays everything is then going to hug a fear and .
and of course is this threat altogether just very ambiguous and also very theoretically , but just in the area of the semen of the connection of the flower to plant play bees a very , very big role .
there 's research , the show that capacity to percent in our food , synthesize food n't do n't there praying when we do n't bees would be .
even hear sounds like this place , because it as normal for us and we 're bees might also not too many muscles .
there now imagine some time also a very interesting movie , , for the subject .
and i recommend you look at this point .
now , but the library , we focus on the lord of perpetual right now with honeybees working in his sweetheart , in the importance of bees clearly make .
that make it here at a school at and he gets us now , falls over his work to talk .
please , mr. .
yes , good evening .
just once a big , praise of mr. and at the whole .
that i showed up with my project , diversity of something that contribute oyster about life of bees .
and also still under a wing of a little bit about little to tell that make fun .
because i take insisted that the least of them to educate kids would it now today night a company within minutes in the basics of beekeeping introduce to want .
please , i do n't have no .
but perhaps , grit to me , they tend to bring that this starts to love or a certain empathy you very resistant to develop and you to biologists for this insect .
my name is thomas , i 'm a few years , young , i 'm with a wonderful woman married , father of five children still not and i different and doors and working years ago in the with adolescents and adults .
i am a member in and in charity side .
and work now in the detector go from with our oldest students in .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in beekeeping .
well actually a of and act of .
our flying classroom is rather a , a quiet , a quiet thing .
and they 're going also to calm .
it 's almost an issue .
and not free have the ancient greeks the context from honey and so , and the stroke .
and in a wonderful verse of homer describes it 's like the his to the poet fashionable to him to inspire , that he once dense that can .
but the go up absolutely not themselves while but they send their blue bees and now the denser the lips to wax and they crawl into the mouth go and then beyond with him later , the words like , honey from the flow .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully , grit to me today evening .
yes .
fly classroom .
i come to the project .
one of this , this the statue now my students with me along built have come to thirty thousand days in a .
in schools of us in into the secondary or in the in the of or in the fuel .
a bottom-up or in for us in .
the teachers , this project stays okay with me in the classroom and we seek a out of place for such a .
civilizations end of windows so the kids something can see during this month .
and above all things , so the bees , then there acids are from the nightmare out and then can .
there 's thanksgiving day window a peanut created .
so .
and then premise that lasts for me on the .
i suppose so as a and ' yet from a pair of two out and now here in this go .
important on this on these are so honeybees .
also important , we have here , and here has to leading edge another fresh it , so fresh eggs .
and then acts as a to show up .
there 's the honey inside .
the need them , if hair bad weather and they do n't fly drones .
so .
it looks something out .
then came up again oldenburg and immediately beginning of transportation of the polling places , or at the dining room , in school .
and now begins about the wonderful .
my ladies and gentlemen these bees place inside the then in the class cafe gratefulness spontaneously a crisis .
you people who made no longer .
they are lonely .
you find your queen did n't .
and this is important task from the , when he this robot that he fertilizers that the queen 's in ancient people who stays .
that are so not on these two radio transmitter .
and they 're sad , these bees .
you 're starting point to .
yes , the says , you .
you hear .
it tastes almost a higher than if you normally in their with a queen translator .
and now begin a .
my ladies and gentlemen , in one night to build them approaching now the necessity , a new regime for reasons , and all happened without , without conferences , no discussions , no views and conflicting .
here is that people who agreed to make then in the first night here 's a .
because without queen going , that people who after six weeks longer exist .
because of lives only six weeks harvesting .
so .
and in this first night phosphorus from one of this a pencil out an egg , and bring in this go .
and there should get r-i-a-a queen going .
every one of them in the curriculum had to say , look like ? because you go ?
yes , genetically engineering , but it all genetically engineering .
this is true .
and now begins about the wonderful .
that egg what this swallows in the , hillary would happen in a queen .
the egg does the first three days versions of genetic code looks like the .
after being fed by a .
you know this term .
and immediately to change themselves on this way represent the genetic code .
i 'm going through the in the changes .
we did earlier 've ever heard that 's what we eat , surely , what makes us will .
and at the queen 's really wonderful to experience .
three days and so , egg , five days .
and get the students all .
you see in class .
and then becomes visible cell with a wax and all happened then also not , because remember that people now , democratic institutions , or because a says , why should be , or you one from says , you make the moment .
no , that happens .
my ladies and gentlemen , this is a or a decision .
and then waiting for students eight days everyone in my students know , three five eight a queen power diffusion of days that these queen .
and a day , if you get so to happen ? the teachers has in which there are at the students in the morning about five o'clock , yeah .
and then say , the mother , # time , which is because with you go ?
yes , i have in the school .
yes , why because this ?
yes , our queen .
yes ?
and then are the morning about six in the school .
and then hit on their grove of those , because they want to how these queen , now .
and if you really experience can then hear you first thing .
these queen .
so .
another little bit higher .
and then come and slice those queen free .
first , what these queen power , urbanization their wing from and there 's now with her case people what you sculpt a queen pulled has her touches them , their .
people who has already been an identity .
now are three hours , five days in length of those queen cancerous .
from the front monster their .
behind comes the dung out from the people from this .
and after five days fly these queen transitions from the out .
some of thinking now , yes , â™« i 've ever seen as a in .
wait , .
what is completely different .
-- let us .
these queen of flying now , repetitive without , without out of this out 10 to two miles up .
they have probably 've ever seen in their .
in the and being located in an unparalleled now , by seven meters 12 drones , the male bees .
well fortunately , like in islam , where this guy different women have allowed this is the queen , the seven meters 12 men has .
and all happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone comes from behind these queen , and these queen collects the moment in this unparalleled all , what they plant seeds need to three years long eggs to shine .
for the drone is also a proves experience .
if they finished with dying and gets dead , from the sky .
and then came the queen never return and starts , eggs to shine .
there are always a two students in the class , who immediately see .
see again snap through the queen .
yes .
and then ends slow this project in the school because now going back and the queen and the becomes far too deeply supported inside .
and then come i one evening when been to this .
' from outside , and the next morning ' i ran with the queen and these bees to me on the .
and there see here you still the queen .
yes .
pharaoh .
and vague mostly unexplored yet 12 .
and then came this yes , these two come now here in a .
in a full floor , in a prey and now can , that african attitude and giants are .
why bees in the school ?
my ladies and gentlemen , the children until we forget that never more .
yes .
there 's am not just like that in this class then the students the whole time with the bees together 're not the entire school nor am in this class go .
and the teachers , when he knows something , when he 's something that can , if it as he has got a little prepared has been able to be one of osama after another plug .
let them , bees and the r-i-a-a front of years we 've , where people who have been the honey , very much .
imagine a few months has shown in israel years old found in those people back the bees holding very much .
in any human culture has to bees .
or backwards , the bees were at every culture much .
in china , in india in , in egypt , in greece in rome .
wherever they were pretty much .
the human cultures my ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can be a , a plug it might be a plug .
my ladies and gentlemen , you know what 's plants or the trees are bees , what you need ?
that they got out now , anything find that moment in summer , in agriculture .
there is out , this is a green desert to our bees .
yes ?
he could sculpt with the students in the go and there on flowers plants bees , calculus tag and look at how long haul that moment from zero to destroy plants ?
how long , they 're on the individual semen ?
and how long haul it , until they never return .
he can r-i-a-a dinners .
how i was a ?
yes .
you know , whether it is that in which the top for the top or the r-i-a-a flat page for the top ?
let you measure exactly while .
he can be a math -- a plug .
yes , my ladies and gentlemen , he can with the students in fact , the on this discovery .
and then gets him to the question , how could karl from newly the nobel even get ?
because he accepted me that the bees can see in the hive .
but , my ladies and gentlemen , in a hive .
actually looks as a bee , nothing .
and just the professor , many years in at the university taught has changed in that the bees , there a to do on individual .
like a net from the wax on the a to do , and now with daylight your tax adviser and the bees , the , the contact with their legs , with their .
you see what these bees in the school to do ?
it 's , and the kids lose their fear the bees .
and create an awareness for the bees .
they learn , , what the bees do .
and they get a warning front of these creatures that 's in basically basically just for us who lives .
the bees do wax still not even a pounds per people in .
years ago the only way , candles materials .
they accumulate on the out of the trees .
this is a , with you get people out .
and now imagine you time ago , the summer , that 's -- the bees on such a narrow 360 degrees centigrade .
hey , because there without end .
no , at the bees do n't .
because they have in this natural antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and so that they him , it stands for a high-quality .
someone who suffers from alzheimer 's a radiologist , the cellphone today to a go back into a doctors leaving , using it out of people .
obviously got a grid before and with with a and so forth , actually happening with nothing .
yes , and then my ladies and gentlemen fruit flies the bees course , too , we would be less apples , if the bees , there 's not fly would sort of some economists like the chinese acts on the and they themselves locally .
because there is more extraction .
look at the , because out on the wet 's also grows on the , where the cows cows .
and fruit flies the bee while , idris moves their nectar and these .
and now comes the cow and blow up the and just because they pick it can digest .

and a went through the secondary .
and more than half said , oh yeah , you want to do we also .
my students experience this was a legend appreciation and the acoustic between , in ordinary and the people getting through the bees cage .
you to meet them up and they get self-confidence , my students and a certain proud .
how come you to bee ?
the question is wrong .
you ought to say , how come you to the ?
and there palace ' i also because it is the person , of the other people to him a new there .
and he says , so that someday make this point .
the end of a little verse by of .

thank you .
hello , dear friends in all the world .
welcome to your presentation to my venezuela .
this project in my nephews and my wife .
it 's the struggle for an end of the female .
in my eyes that 's greatest crimes of humanity , because it 's a thousand years ago .
the society against women with still sacrifice every day .
first ' i think .
my name is , i come from .
there â™« i proposed a primate .
you can remember thinking that my job is n't have .
i felt wrong .
and why was i 'm glad that i 'm in the issue well , and exciting amounts of interface .
for example , this .
with a massive over the atlantic of africa after brazil .
on the sail a verse of the in brazil , the imminent genocide on the last the , to prevent .
this was a ride , where i 'm more was as much more than .
yet been such nonverbals lifting more interested in the media to find and even a small ordinary as i could his cause world to your language to put it .
keep me with their own in ethiopia .
back pressure where war between and ethiopia and we were those dictators there .
and despite all cruelty , we 're experiencing , experiencing that we 're on the other side of infinite hospitality of us , arab hospitality .
and knocks happened that we invaded were and our two , you see here , up with their bodies as living in front of us , and the said that 's my .
if you kill praise immunized them through we lit shoot .
something that observed keep me , none other cultures found .
and back in a young age 've learned that you take islam is not reduce that can you to terrorism .
well christians want am not reduced to be on their terrorism .
for example .
the , the .
but rather on the disagreement values , how scripture , social responsibility .
that 's the values , for yourself , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after years i 'm again in this has been , along with my wife .
and actually stopped we followed by this female .
when i 'll hear that percent of everyday casualties are the rest 're christians and keep praying , i thought how can be a way of islam on the next interested in terror even more in the shoes maximize efficient ?
and the idea was born in the highest makers of islamism led to bring the southern to sin to explain .
we searched for in german organizations , we do n't found .
because we had we 'll listen , now would we know possibly date of islam be absolutely not .
you would my throat .
on of international we then our own organization company .
and both of and independent .
and to combine those magazines even at coal to see immortality that we images .
talk about manipulation of a scarcity .
and therefore restaurants and i once in this desert using 3d camera these images to do .
the dire bloody images , the meantime i 'm not , but i want to divert the crime .
girl in the age of four weeks from a while to your marriage will drift off their parents and relatives , on the earth placed you start sustaining itself on the limbs , and cutting them without the vagina and the away with one of the to , without with the instruments no knowledge of hygiene , and the anatomy and the quad .
what you a consequence is one flush of the size .
long now a .
if you women typically work busy changing two weeks .
oldenburg ruins of the body and soul , denied of their dignity .
this was the beginning of the so-called .
in the is rising costs further .
this guy has to open .
he has never been a woman seen .
so much he said , oh , , but no problem .
you your penis on a and then you poke and you rent from .
and if you do not talented , is also not bad .
then sal you know that knife and on .
this is .
frog dies a third of girls .
this was given primarily three months acne .
imagine shock has this girl his language lost .
that 's the , even some in asia .
the most are khan .
and police kept us muslims wondered why raised their done ?
was the answer to have we do that stands in the koran .
nothing written in the koran them , quite the contrary .
every mosque , chickens day in prayer , how are unique , the creator , is perfect , .
but they seem unlikely to think , what you there praying .
they have a to be the women wrong ideology has and why you look now as ordinary open-source version of women .
but now had we are pictures of the first was this .
he shares his willingness to a conference .
there were hard discussions , two days in length .
but we had the on our hand , the highest on our side .
and then came the great decision , the southern is against all rights violations by religion , we need to him marriage .
as recently demonstrated the way of this new signed .
and if you africa and the know , you know you just demonstrated for these people .
and it was celebrating , like this success did we 'll also in other countries .
quick example still accounting for us the highest standard of country his message that 's a crime , on writing and now in the to wear .
weeks were we were traveling with your own .
a hundred bullets we 're pretty much .
and where we came , we 've just open ears , open arms and the historical as sacred hospitality until .
and when we have this country eventually abandoned wanted to say the big scholar and i want you now really all countries voyager ?
so much lifetime will you no longer going .
he does right .
i 'm and there have you slow to deal to go .
and especially interested in had he 's an idea .
he said , if you accomplish , the ten muslim world at a table to bring to explain the southern to sin , then it 's a sin .
and i flew home cairo in the and -- the mosque comparable with the .
and watch for quite the , his professor for ali got us a .
he stopped at the idea of was thrilled , especially interested , when we him that we fund would .
and do we picked about us support .
and then he said he said , i 'm the conference not just , as we hold tight asked natalie , but i 'm the responsibility .
and that does it 's done .
over cairo , sometime during years of our transparent .
international to ban the of female body by female .
under the one of professor for ali .
and all , they 're coming .
a hundred , but the highest the world .
in the middle of qatar , this guy has in and in the rest of europe , he 's of , because of cartoons .
so men who live and death decide to get .
but those rats also the other .
left the , right , my .
the highest the world .
about eight propellers , i 'm just add a vacuum ago , personally .
and then figured i love embraced .
it started the conference .
and beneath our sign at of links from egypt .
the in egypt , of woman mubarak and , germany .
so much for the theme of islam is not .
we were equally competent loaded up on their way more time , which is terrible geodesic women , there , with the .
and then letting your film shows , .
reality .
the men were scratching eyes .
they moved on the back behind the doors for the only two hours after you decided to a wrote a .
the cracks up the cameras , announced , what you decided ethanol .
and the most important sentence inside , that was this .
female is a financial crimes against highest values of islam .
he .
we thought , the job is done had but the calculation without our experience .
because the embarrassment about the chest the woman to talk , is stronger remained as any mind .
why we 've .
we have that we have the conference documented in this so-called golden book .
a for this world .
and because ali , the , it as well , was a book , does he did with a blessed .
it gets us from the hands shark .
we were in many countries had to get conferences circus by the left-hand highest .
and you read this with interest some were so thrilled that they have this book did .
unfortunately , but have the most not the courage constitution , now also to announce that .
over the chest the female oyster can not in the mosque talk .
just some have the courage queue .
they 're least in the universities went on .
and sometimes we have some of bold found the fact , in the mosque about have to see here .
and then goes beyond reporting speakers in the .
and that are bats are affected .
that will spread .
but i walk back pocket .
there are all the milk on the hot rocks , and why i work on many other strategies , this issue again .
the southern .
but my sighted experience .
i want to the great message the highest the world utter end footsteps of islam myth here at the kaaba , in a sanctuary .
ca n't think so , but in the .
if here four million people fuse together , men and women of islamic currents .
then ' i 'm going to all those and the king my transparent showing up from the thames .
how i do this long time practicing i in the .
unfortunately lack of mine before the last , that would be the king .
but i 'm sure , when he brought it would he thanks .
for a to these women to help .
for the other , to the world time to show , which the disagreement values of islam is , instead , this sort of viruses to grow .
from terrorists than .
if i do n't do then ' i might this , what in a long debut had .
that least a lot in the mosque join in all the world .
and we our transparent there on the thames could .
and maybe instructor , i remember that little girl his daughters are no longer need .
then has changed my life so right .
and i want to intervene at any kind of the now heard one or seen has a transformational .
but not join 's been a .
we need to the southern africa , ton step , otherwise cable , i 'm here by this stage then right away .
and now i 'd give you conclude the design of my before even show .
this is my , my .
and this is in all of showing up arabic in the name of and that has always .
there underneath we 'll also in german .
female with the koran , and the ethic of islam incompatible .
it 's and one of discrimination , of islam .
thank you beautiful .
thank you .
so , i asked amy ' so first place .
so saw the left , you as a refugee in germany was .
most attention to have my mother , my brother and i first time as a little package .
it 's not burnt .
my mother was completely terrified , because they do n't understand power enabled us now eat mozart did .
december third day were we finally .
we stood watch trash wanted this stuff again throw chemicals coming in a woman and simply acted out .
they tried to us to explain hey , you could eat .
this is not .
it tastes actually very good .
it 's a cheese .
my mother drew the eyebrows high and we laughed .
cheese .
in my homeland we 've collapsed , but does n't like smell .
i 'm and years old .
imagine fifteen years i 'm with my mother and my brother of china for germany fled .
of these cult of ' i now talk .
but especially interested in about it i worry about the people are these cult allow tribes and to a success did have .
but first curl ' i asked them , where i hong kong .
i am .
it 's a little , the pacific northwest of china life .
and this region grows from the chinese autonomous area called .
it is for 100 miles from germany away .
in china million total 10 million , but in the largest community outside china .
and those lives and so here because we in china under constant pain need .
hundreds chinese were extra for reservations so we in our own indigenous to a minority become are .
our own tongue , turned out of education stethoscope .
in schools and in university will fit more chinese taught .
and our religion professors we also not free brothers .
the losing so their culture and identity .
and if you remember someone bold and for the right-hand side of tide losing long , torture , or even die .
this was also the reason why my parents looking for decided , have to us kids to escape .
this was and i was back 11 years old .
this picture is before our escape born .
we did n't enough money , why was my dad once time behind .
i ' i think many people to us at the escape helped so much .
i ' i think many images .
i carry me but first of our .
i ' he carefully before me , when i my eyes .
he was big had r-i-a-a at the time and we met him still with his little on a parking space .
the first rate was handsome .
i know that many of a negative image of did that the small traders do want to refugees functions and remember anything except for the fates interest .
but i belong to say i grab him as calling , rather than .
because he shares atheism .
he stood on airport in on a and changed except for the last end , whether we also really safe from the results .
airport , we came up on and i know yet , as my mother and somehow help me saying goes straight out from the airport .
turns you ca n't care .
until we out there are .
because i had occurred in my hand a stamp and there was also my photo inside but there stood up a stranger name , .
i had dropped by the .
and i carry me mysterious whisper of me he had my pass into the hand .
silence .
sweat .
a long lens .
we were finally .
in came ' i started a lot of negotiation that we somehow highly compatible so much .
i carry me at the woman , with us in the usual background .
in a with four per family .
least forty children .
a and a kitchen .
there alien faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a parts .
there was eating the similarities and homework done .
friends came now not to visit because i , where we were .
just talking about the in the knew malaria .
they knew my story and coaching me very , bulgaria , to me .
for example , gave me to what i now , no longer do .
but they helped me also kind of german kitchen meet .
i spent my whole adolescence in .
this was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with our children no her husband and still in the uncertainty because we had am just a and i could anytime be .
i ' i believe that i really extremely aggressive was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing moment here , everything to talk , but now i have just to my story today .
i was extremely aggressive and enrolled myself in the school bad somehow focus .
and brought us more serene , catholic where we first time with ordinary kid in touch came .
using normal album `` i kids , not in a north had .
i ' i also reminded me and my brother , or sent very much .
just so we little playwright .
i ' i also on multiple with our homework done have , because our parents not a german could .
or have to us just drawn .
we have us still very glad that .
i know yet , how we always before the fence helpless and waited until these people came up , because somehow took on foreign people for us time , and this was us back important .
after two years came finally , my father for germany .
this problem was but that it directly from makoko was because it in egyptian any place worth for him there .
i carry me at the very much engaged relieved to be able has to my father before the south china to preserve ourselves , they succeeded in fact that he helped us in north grateful .
i carry me at this time where i really get very , very glad that was , because after six years of membership when we finally into a normal apartment cities .
we got a for three years , and we had finally , a very own apartment with a own bathrooms and one of your own kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was stripped very small and i had no desk inside , but it was good , i could my door dragging them .
and i carry me that i the time , yes , very well used i , but i was still without a degree leave .
i looked for me really none of perspective .
there came a , for me in further support weight and it still doing on the idea that i over the second of my avatar .
first , then the .
i thank the teachers , really reminded me believed , and i was really not just to the long tail i even triple to adulthood .
after i came to .
and before i 'm going to come up playing my cafeteria with my best friend dick .
is an organization or a project of organized .
but i was no good thing to keep praying , i also just made since we through a place had where we just did easter could .
we had a , nigeria , we our could .
and the head of helped us to somehow that we our problems of his talk could and he schemes for us and managed us at all of questions somehow .
and after i came to , .
and this is a project , where young people without a degree of the ability to catch up .
he looked really quite well done , and i keep reported that stuff is something which i also slightly .
by and the introduction to come up a filmmaker on us .
he made the film about life of my friends and me .
and the movie won lots of prices .
we 're larvae , that people around for our story of satellites .
he was a very special feeling , because we 've never experienced had that people our listening have .
and this was such a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want anymore .
i want to anything from my life make .
one of , a for refugees helped me on the idea for to a of the transformational .
but because i in the building me totally stripes have had ended i just randomly at a for a and the title is one until four .
so i was i just right .
i played with .
and this amazing is that after a performance two editors , from on me .
and i asked natalie , if i interest should just once its own to do .
i thought to me , super .
clearly jazz musician , i started .
and i made for , now , pulse and one of my posts about a , in which i also ourselves was for the european grammy .
and i 'm hoping as well actually won .
delusions studying i look at the virtue of and movie ever in the third year and i 'm the .
and everything would be for me to do n't been able to otherwise individual or organizations like or projects like a good look for me poorly adapted .
they have passed me believe they have to me spaces open , you have noticed grameen showed up as i my place in the society i can .
and so come ' i now to them .
each of you have the ability to people like me to help second chance to get and their lives or their place in the society to find .
because the people , enriched get a hundred refugees looking at each of you 're full of hope and each of you have a large potential .
they do with a big determination able many terrible hurdles behind you to grow .
and with this determination could really big , profit for germany , to go for every single of us as well .
and i could actually thousands things to talk , what you do that can , but because i no longer enough time i although actually says , a minute compass , i 'm a liter .
now your phone out you can i do n't talk , that 's no code can .
scan the code project and then they come on the side of with many suggestions , what you selection can do .
and that would agree quite well , help .
i 'm now long time for their engagement and we see ourselves out hope .
and scan the code project .
i carry it .
so many of having mobile phones are not in the hand .

yes , is not degrees my .
daisy â™« ooh , young adults , ooh , young university ooh .
yes .
thanks for graduate listening .
you plugged great .
thank you , my ladies and gentlemen .
let me fight with a question beginning .
why should you look at pittsburgh ?
i think , everyone , the tax uses should ask , whether it eventually potentially the society which kindness can .
the answer is quite clear .
we know that cage that the expectancy for the point of birth just to 30 percent genetically engineering .
which means it has to threaten to give the impact on a very much .
why do know what we still more like this little ?
why are we can assess of news out , you the first part of each consequence ?
you remind you all up fifteen years , suddenly found .
it was fat .
you thought , if you fat from the food , are we all and be healthy old .
what percentage of shelves with various in american supermarkets lead weight and what does n't talk about changed dramatically that the americans every year thicker become are .
then once you said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the .
what happened to see the , and so on lead weight .
it 's so i always been r-i-a-a new narrative poems village .
where the whole ?
now , the reason for my taste first piece at least , that we combine traditional approaches to science .
einstein example of a alisa 's here .
the know you all .
published a pop-up magazine a new .
the top of for this monster year .
keith crunch was seven years lived in place one grammy .
then died in the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean .
the oldest person who has proven depending on the planet lived one .
years old gotten .
i know , there somewhere in the people who claim they 're , you ca n't just your n't find .
jean is actually gone .
and they listened to respond to smoke started but with ice sheet passed around then finally with the path of the virtue to follow up dieting is to smoke .
with you 'll die .
which tells us ?
not sure that cigarettes healthy plants .
but it tells us that aging very complicated and that we have clean statistics need we need simple experimental systems and we need simple , asking questions .
r-i-a-a quite simple question , and a very simple , in different countries is women are older than men .
microfinance is that ?
we know it 's cage .
this is on testosterone end well , what in the male vitamin d .
and there fingertips quite simple evidence for men are exactly how old as women .
can now everybody to themselves think , whether a .
austria 's a beans country .
but it go even better tips , no fear .
voters should we hats [ with to confuse it .
sounds complicated , but just about calculus to illustrate .
there visited so somebody r-i-a-a grandma , and ask , what they have , because so different sheep or different eaten , that they 've gotten so old arguments ?
ah .
the granny has every day 10 cigarettes .
this is probably the secret their ages , right ?
about having 10 cigarettes maybe just not .
or but they have and the granny would be without the ten cigarettes even older technologies .
even the hard stats is not always .
there for example r-i-a-a very hard stats that shows that people , the in the website older technologies when people who does n't do .
reciprocal .
.
lies at the ?
no .
it is to talk about that the people just enough money in the pocket have to feel good to her age and the standard treatments to care .
if i but one group of a to forage give and this group with 20 percent longer lives than r-i-a-a the thermostat does n't gain weight , but otherwise very precise moment beekeeping was then figured i actually probably a factor in the diet affected .
and actually are like trying made met .
got to tell that 's very rewards but even i do with my checklist agree 'm sure that breasts that life logo .
and worked for the sizes of organisms .
for example , in bacteria .
you see here r-i-a-a of bacteria .
if we breasts , in the line showing then life are significantly longer .
the same applies to fly mice and recently awarded only insights about two years in the united showed that it even for the monkey recognized .
pretty much about moore 's not recognizing that thin to be .
it works even at the kitchen .
and this is one another experiment , what in the united states did was .
what has shown here done ?
you have r-i-a-a taken and he 's like this so-called symptoms , a diet , where you so many of this day at night gain weight .
and vote disneyland yes , the mice are starving gotten sick and have r-i-a-a quite disgusting had and bad .
now once you r-i-a-a parallel triangles and that has exactly the same number of fed at all that breaks r-i-a-a pause it was .
the last night n't eat allowed to pay last night twice as much eating .
and these now is and healthy and she has also not .
although both mice , feeding were .
both have equal much eating .
a sick and removing healthy .
what happens because triangles ?
it 's a process called or .
when whatever they organisms , or cells food remove finally catches the organism on the ingredients in the cell or ingredients to conclude then put energy to do .
that make sense .
and that looks like .
you can see , as in the cell dot up against mainly , to junk , during the ages .
and then with the stomach , the ingredients are and the cell as energy back to provide ago .
so be picked damage the average age of across borders cattle .
this is perfect molecular biology , or the of the times report .
so , to sum of breasts logo live in various organisms .
and it 's probably assume that , even at people worked .
and we 're learning patience , that they vibrate is n't like in the recommended every little day with 20 combat should .
no .
but they should they say , if you 're hungry people , ah , maybe it 'll just the .
welcome them their hunger , like a friend .
and make the same sense .
as gifts to nine nine percent of history has the person that 's done , when he famine had ?
yeah , he 's a hunting gone .
we go to regularly consider the fridge oklahoma , if we 're hungry people .
and this is safe against the biology .
now know what we course , and the script already in the bible , in edition of verse , the mind is soldiers , but this meat is weak .
paradise look for us very different from .
this arise from in a paradise showed .
the three here about works well , eat the whole day , let you could serve .
and this is kind of the actual .
we have us so on the search for accounting done , the molecular answer the , although the organism eat .
that could for people 's interesting , to their not enough natalie .
and it could we might imagine one of the hardest of life to preserve .
the question is so we can , the , the cellular radio , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds of a thousand accounting scans , natural enhancement .
we did indeed a found that 's called .
is a gray , in all of organisms called fmri , but also in all of organisms during the less likely .
in the skin is alive .
people have significantly less in the skin as .
and if we now on human cells going to for example , if you see following .
this is the r-i-a-a humane cell here .
the , the nucleus , we give an oldenburg and we see many thousands of these little in the cell emergence of the junk , during the ages , .
the cells would clearly just like to look .
and worked in various organisms .
here for example , shown on a .
so we have r-i-a-a gray found the molecular .
life , because the organisms so even shorter .
and the answer is astonishingly well you see here r-i-a-a typical of a .
it 's simple .
within days are all dead , after forty days is about half dead .
when always ourselves into the drinking water going to show up , colorful to be the animals older and survive better .
we know as well , that human cells that we of have in culture about three times as long survive , if we do with romo .
and the latest research eggs even close that our own lives of all over mice from logo is going .
and it 's not just life , it 's also the .
these mice are significantly .
so .
now you want of course , all know , where it comes up ?
how the name already says , it is allowing sperm discovered met , there comes in very high concentrations ago .
but i can you have comfort , even in green pepper mushrooms cheese , and a product from , what in japan lot of life enjoys making this is that occurs much more recently .
we have we then said , if against helps them into junk that helps if halt even combat ?
they need transformational know that the common denominator of all diseases is that as the ages in the brain .
and we 've indeed experiments led done .
they 're exposed to wonder , we have the door flies done .
seymour to be limitless too , if you 're old journals .
they have more in the brain , if you 're old journals .
and the molecular mechanisms for memory charge these are quite similar , like watching people .
now ask you anyway , how to hell does the guy that memory of fruit measured ?
this is this experiment , what we share with this delightful seals from the college berlin did have .
you take a hundred fruit and ban the show a tolerance policies somebody touches the love .
.
and grow up in this .
then take the same fly to give them in the next chamber , and give you , whisper in another touches the love , namely .
we let them to enjoy , as you but the r-i-a-a ?
classic .
then take them once the same fly to do this dough .
the driving this degree in the down , because you see .
and if you here downward spiral here to give them from one side and of other hand hovering .
where go together while ?
yeah .
to .
except two here .
that 's the .
or to say , we have a character .
i love my and i let 's grab me not by so the r-i-a-a reward .
okay .
but the r-i-a-a form of character , with the age of entropy .
not just at flying .
and we could actually fly through having a , on a level never sacrifice .
and the , in the brain mapping of both were once in mineral resources .
which means that produces not only battling , not only battling mental disorders of barbecue .
and this is important , because we want am not the span definition se do .
it makes no sense of the time to do .
and i want you do n't have released , without them more time a few practical tips to give us we uploaded younger stay .
more time breasts .
it wo n't worry that you weigh reduced , or so .
there way mafia in austria r-i-a-a group of people , the one day eat and one day n't eat .
this is like this so-called under the fort by bernard and .
and holding very good experiments .
which means , it 's .
avoiding .
it wo n't solve complex appear at all too dangerous to be .
it comes to actually taking candy .
you know circumstance that are going to diabetes 1970s , even then when they are .
and you know as well , that sugar growth of tumors repulsive push .
here you see r-i-a-a , the ground moves toward grey .
after thirty days are all dead .
quite doses doses of glucose rich enough .
to a effect to create .
there 's just an example , that works in almost all of organisms that .
eat regular vegetables and vegetables .
avoiding the gift of too much or by at .
you know circumstance that -- and cancer grids can .
moore 's not under conditions for vitamin d .
we 're here we uploaded degrees ' in winter 's a , because vitamin d being by sunlight on the skin educated .
days you least three times per week r-i-a-a half hour sports , this is very trivial .
cigarettes despite the examples cost 10 percent fifteen years lifetime .
do you look at times of eternal occasionally the quiet places .
the impact of praying , such pressure on the span is , occupying .
because monks lives almost as long mating , how women .
, who live longer than .
live longer than .
but life still longer than .
just die used as .
microfinance is that ?
people assume that has anything with algae enhancement , to do .
senate , the senate , this is quite easily .
if now here 's a day window is then ' i presented with en route .
and what similar happen , probably in their .
scaling , and so what are smoking cigarettes under conditions there .
therefore does alcohol especially interested in r-i-a-a effect .
a permanent partner very much or the r-i-a-a family is increasing longevity associate .
they should not at a lot of road north .
now think they equal .
this has but with absolutely nothing to do .
it comes to .
you can measure more elaborate somebody on a lot of road tokyo , healthier than any of it in blood .
and also , when he says , i keep me as modern-day used .
i can pretty good sleep and the noise makes me , nothing left .
true no .
he has yet empowered in blood and this is bad .
sunlight should be due course .
we know what enzymes , that 's very good metabolic newton did .
especially interested to be the lower .
and we know even more and mice against wildlife .
knew way our grandmothers even exposing us with and so on a very much .
sweater nor no sense .
several studies verify that dark chocolate against dementia , smiling can .
just recently is a beautiful study showed me , that the r-i-a-a half board dark chocolate per day one on the level , one of bringing can .
similarly suspected that you of coffee there is now thinner .
there is studies show , there is studies that 's not show .
what is clear , is that coffee against diabetes , acts , and so their metabolic performance improve .
and a coffee is the way as a good because he solves the left , how we share with from paris show you could .
r-i-a-a very nice and intricate study in the thousand people in fifteen years long studies were have shown that people , every day r-i-a-a handful nuts eat their uses 20 percent mortality .
this is a romantic value for the r-i-a-a study .
and that 's true for , , , .
not yet to peanuts will considerably easier beans are .
give just started using them , this nuts call it ?
that 's but actually beans .
so for the peanuts moore 's not .
the next point is a little .
avoiding the shot by making a lot of feeding protein , so of meat and , but only if you between and years old data .
r-i-a-a very beautiful new survey showing that they , if you in this to a lot of leather proteins being exposed to take you guys so i 've been increasing as if you a strong discount would .
moore 's not for the time after where leather proteins are good and it 's true course not for children or sends out of leather proteins need and it 's true potential for pregnant and like , it will want .
general avoid them .
whatever they do n't keep you knew already frederick , the plane has the , the , joyful people are signs of health .
all heard in the .
here is the gentleman who has about looking at this regime lived and he 's years old gotten .
he comes from my home from the , it 's seen sick gotten .
and his creative works very good .
he is hiring programmers , faiza is no anecdote is not it lives in a , where it 's particularly a lot of healthy , there .
he has about the followed that i 'm now , frankly i .
we should at all the experiments r-i-a-a important fact but not missing .
namely that one of my consent is not vegetables will not a to make it seems , and so eventually a .
you the old man gave them and that could be a mistake in our culture , to .
wrote the best-selling novel part of a year before his death .
the brothers .
a piece of the contemporary critics especially interested in the adolescent fresh .
i thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i give grammar .
a question , where now , no one up have , because it 's a little expert who of you very lonely ?
but very low .
lower left when i thought .
it has but probably reasons why does not reported very much , even the people for itself develops branches you would .
many people confuse and loneliness and think that would .
about is not at the case .
you will see loneliness is actually rather a phenomenon among humans as alone to be .
maybe lies in it also believe that you do n't have reported very much , because the question fuzzy christ .
feel you feeling lonely road is how lonely ?
you can you the lonely feel , no lonely to be .
and you can lonely be without moving into the moment lonely to feel .
loneliness than having too much to shame to do .
well that 's some now here , have evolved to loneliness to .
loneliness going in a shame , shame going into loneliness .
loneliness takes time .
even justin 's going to move now this was no one semester have in the few seconds , where i show gave myself .
loneliness needs .
loneliness takes time , to remember her , even aware to be .
and loneliness need also practice , to talk to speak to get .
and this exercise have we tso 's not .
we have neither the language yet we sign for us speaks to recognize when we are lonely ?
there to loneliness two , where i always been tribe am .
a part of humanity , say , you is from beginning of a lonely .
of the innate capacity to death is you actually just a lonely .
there are few moments in life where you can .
such people go then you tend to and tear along the whole day away .
i keep ' no time , is so you .
and then there are people probably less , say , everything is with everything connected .
i there is really absolutely not so , i just a part of the big universe .
and there are great group , to the i also belong to the time so , even so thinking .
think , okay , today i 'm lonely and at next day , oh , it depends but everything connected together .
if we of loneliness think that gets us more georges the whole lot of loneliness is an example .
and loneliness is of loneliness to the sick looking at a freeway .
but over these , about these large ' i today is n't do n't speak , but i want to talk about the little over the rehearsal , where loneliness we also in such a theater desertification can .
i 'd also not talking about burden of the .
loneliness at other determine gets us usually not hard loneliness for us to detect early .
the photographer sister wrote in the break a few photos taken that i 'll show you want .
how easy ; we always gets , in other loneliness detect .
pretty much know what we all right , whether these people feel really in this moment lonely felt very much .
but who knows it 's not the moment in such event , where you start thinking , all talking together , just find yourself standing on something lost in the corner and does anybody to .
this clash of loneliness know safe here all .
may have some of you today is too long until .
what you compare this does something pulls the phone out very often , even when you could now , very good bye is , on the phone also an escape ago , .
clearly visible , if you on display looks .
what we now here 's not do .
yes , and then there are loneliness to the degrees above you very bedrock of loneliness one on stage hundreds of faces still a and you even something left in the hope to be its text would n't forget .
that 's the , you from outside see .
we other people personality .
but i 'm 'm sure , there are here also people in the room , moving from birth of a lonely feel your entire life many lifetimes , have them , they have been trying to kind of loneliness by itself , you the discussions .
and there in this room guaranteed income people are lonely are , because it on another one human slaves need to be because instead death or because one of separation .
actually uses it also , nothing that still many people , even people , with whom you linked data , to look around , they 're feeling out of lonely .
and there are people who have the relationship to themselves lost find any contact more to remember , are so lonely .
i prefer the digital loneliness .
and ' she jumps out of loneliness .
and loneliness is we trust .
that are people whose work their view looking at social contacts .
even more resilient .
there are n't verify number of any number , when someone enough human guerrillas have to decide not .
we gets up immediately the old people a .
it 's the form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities north connected with very many people at facebook or sms twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness getting bigger gotten .
you can with hundreds of people connected to be no with a single human right connected to be .
it is at the analog loneliness rather of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often against .
this is also believe that the of loneliness a little .
whereas the digital loneliness feel good suitable for and in .
it 's convinced gadgets , that the digital loneliness in the future more cheaply going to move the ways to move to connect the larger teeth .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years , that feeling naked bodies from loneliness very similar to be going to more loneliness call it .
or whether you pay if a new conception find .
but that 's also kind of the problems of philosophers generation .
hardly even bigger than the loneliness itself is the fear of loneliness and from this fear of loneliness that are people in stopping to do ready .
the big , even a man has a wonderful wrote .
in which describes what people all related to do n't alone to be .
they build the cathedral , you witness the children , then again lonely are and alone .
but that does n't named to the fear of loneliness to hills of perpetual money spend .
go .
things reductions .
both the process before the loneliness , because it at least term a touch robot as well the objects themselves , you acquired weight .
the problem is just that it 's very quickly help and holding this article against the loneliness .
therefore must we always been new things to buy us to .
i keep ' time sales for a couple of jumping label seen .
and quite pretty aware of phone communicate with the slogan giants of warcraft ooh .
what 's at jumping is to do have to know you ca n't , but apparently works too .
loneliness than having so nothing to the to do loneliness find underneath those who just so instead .
has a wonderful poem written , and actually answer a verse but at worst of loneliness to .
hands on december heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship or the sort of others listening to monitor and you suddenly terrible alone to feel dreadful lonely to feel and the question to ask , who is this human athletes ?
keep praying , i 'm going to the at something to do ?
a study quote that look at the women around the compass , married , with kids feel .
demonstration missing , because i ireland exists no longer know , if i study even invented i so often keep praying , i told .
but now also totally matter because it at least in studies mostly care and the reaction always equal is that people before me .
that 's feelings that completely obvious , almost always a .
loneliness to each and yet to speak we 're not about them .
talking specifically as little over the loneliness to watch sex .
also has probably seen anybody until .
even as you changed suddenly to think what jazz musician , i 'm here really ?
who is this person in my bed really ?
also a form of loneliness is not necessarily anything to do you 've got to the quality of sexual .
well nothing to do you 've got to the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only not about them , because we do n't look .
we speak only relatively not about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness even when we think .
i stood up so , and keep watching a group of five , better said , three carrying suit and two carrying off .
the two men have on the conversation , the two women in did you the conversation .
and between bolt a little bit with in the hand .
i dated , i have to give the scene absolutely not spread cheaply so you this form of loneliness that everyone too long time in its workforce until has been able to .
itâ€™s loneliness is of .
it 's but also the loneliness is of .
we know all the or i see , sailing boat may also some of their lives of .
in africa into hotels , in bars of times as well no longer know , who actually are , what you do .
where they are , where you wake up .
well this is a form of loneliness to about the not talking gets .
just like this is also , like loneliness than being abused will be .
here is electrical fires .
i did once a told that paul simon written by a client , and said , which has it 's what is quite happened , you can do you ca n't think .
a was alone in the .
so he finds itself to released .
and two months later he also .
and loneliness that came never be alone so .
it comes increasingly in with other feelings .
she has beautiful siblings and they have ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings know , we all .
fear of sadness despair anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire .
therefore my appealing look at the loneliness on .
come and comes in life like and a flood .
let them to and let you ca n't of them flowing .
because there are still something much worse than the loneliness and this is the battery that might think of loneliness that came when you ca n't nothing more noise .
loneliness is part of life .
since i like arguing about loneliness answered i 've come up for me two things change .
first step in my head i do n't have more like a dictator since i recognized keep that i just get over someone mohamed told why he does n't illness because i thought i may losing my the people , perhaps , pat ' i lonely .
i do since liver , since i loneliness in my life accepted i people come and go to grow .
just like this is it with the , how much fun .
well because i 'm wild gotten .
people come and go to make them longer immediately to control limiting , if we turned out an encounter a friendship , or not a partnership shapes could .
as a child was kind of my parents incredibly embarrassing .
can think anybody no with somebody a conversation start .
if in the or in the economy .
every time led to limitless conversations .
as a child was i like you put this embarrassing .
as young adult â™« thank you 're incredibly noble to get this openness to have .
but just since i 'm even so with the loneliness preoccupied , i really succeeds , it looked at least suggests , and then i also like to open .
you see it works lonely and his name themselves ready to make for the next compression .
thank you .
yes , thanks .
i keep praying here three pigs much .
a a and a .
and now , formulation ' i see if you only once access tanzania percentage sustained would you take ?
the most would you the to decide .
and this is a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the slightest effort the biggest effect outcomes .
at health do we somehow differently .
because perception we were adapting to the biggest effect completely recorded eight and decide whether we for other strategies .
we decide whether we for example for the and the stands for sports .
big , but huge effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we decide whether we to .
the stands for diet .
also very large , but still very big effort .
for me why should not so valuable .
and i want you today to talk about them with the slightest effort the biggest outcomes .
if you focus on prevention and health erick comes you make a totally not a drum dancing .
and this topic means that obesity .
and this topic obesity has been in germany long time is not subject , like to this in the .
and then joined the number of obese , in germany been working .
and i keep me asking , what was actually go on the ?
why went like this cyclists suddenly for the top ?
and then figured i expert and i 'm also gotten .
because it was just in years .
what was there ?
there came up germany .
and we 're still and still thicker ?
and i keep on tracking .
come up germany .
and obesity temperature .
and in years increases the curve more time right at the ride up .
and what comes straight up germany ?
and and and , and how it means .
and we 're still and still thicker ?
hometown , then keep me one and one .
because it was yeah yeah .
sports make the thick .
and naturally ' i now , not here , to them to say that sports thick power .
because this is true no .
but one we 've now together neurogenesis .
the flood of becoming emerging -- and does n't necessarily lead , that we and carbs are .
what 's so then ?
the diet ?
and also because there r-i-a-a â™« great study from the states .
also have a problem with obesity .
and they have in the nfl .
and then you wanted to her shortly after a look at what happens because triangles ?
and they 've seen people assume that actually becoming less fat on , but the people take , wherever fewer calories you to be but still noticing .
and that was the paradox .
and why did it 's called .
we can you explain this ?
actually allowed them into the body like a station of life .
because we grew up so the r-i-a-a big .
and on one hand coming up a , actually do we all over the fuck are getting this was burned .
and here 's the energy than power .
if we now , but over here all be in our station and when we on the other side glucose on the energy in the station and it makes bang .
the human body does n't fight bang .
ca : the energy stored .
and launches into form of fat .
our greatest and .
what happens but if we gave way we have heard of energy and yet you see the energy then makes it just a conclusion .
the has come up drastically reduces impact .
this is where morocco even did n't live more redundancy .
we 're hopeful only still muscle .
and it 's exactly what happens .
our grandparents are the last 20 kilometers to walk grades .
and we come today degrees once upon a million two miles and that 's the positive estimates .
there are trials , the reports of five -- 10 meters .
i assure you still something with my friend mike talk .
banana and you my degrees ' the chair ?
mike , tide â™ª degrees ' time ?
mike 's the americans .
he is very shy , he 's not a lot of talking about .
and he was back about this study about and sitting now here .
he 's this typical urban designer jeans and he has a into the hand .
and mike eat whenever less and increasingly less and take nothing yet , and yet realize he always and still noticing .
why ?
because mike only still sitting .
and i whistled even tracking how much exercise mike as a day he and keep him twice as a behind in the pocket hackers and at night â™« i again .
and there stood fuck thousand steps .
this was so the distance that mike has the morning , from for the car with the car into the office there course , a little coffee partners and the evening again back .
and he came up thousand steps .
that means that mike came on this day 10 minutes on his legs .
hours and fifty minutes sitting mike or lay mike .
amongst these conditions creates disease by itself .
and mike 's not so dick , because he too much eating well as long it 's the top always been generated this but not consumed by he would necessarily always thicker at the energy moving .
and the first into the energy , how to show looks at its .
but energy remains n't there .
remember sometime back in blood .
and also there 's active and quiet and quiet on his .
so the .
so if you the energy into the blood , then talk the doctors of stress and high .
and this , showing how to power around little holes in these .
and a fortune floating because even whole fat dancing and so , well over these little wounds and we speak of or .
and now comes from heart right under pressure , because now have to his blood from these tight pots pumps and we speak of pressure .
and if this pressure goes on such a true , then makes a hug both in the body bang .
and if at heart happens , then calling us that attack .
and if in mind happens then calling us that stroke .
and even in germany dies every second of attack , stroke .
which means , in germany dies every second point .
and also mike gets so not so sick because he 's no calories drives not because he does not at more moved .
and if you these interconnections n't know , if seeking you always on the wrong spot .
for example , watching totally diet .
i keep degrees ' night before first diet at the amazon entered and actually get dementia .
and if each book is just so few inches thick and we would have here , would take a thirty feet high tower recent .
and i keep the time for you all read .
and there stays inside and this is now really important if you more energy contact so more food as they consume then they are starving .
and if you less energy contact and when they consume then they are thinner .
that 's brilliant .
but why investments we tend books ?
that makes just a conclusion .
this instinct is inherently huge but also include fellow rwandan .
well , why fails , a diet , hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet and not a lifestyle .
what opt in the deployment , we here first three weeks to make and here first five weeks if we followed by looking at this struggle , once in the ordinary everyday return to our ordinary lifestyle .
whatever arises then actually within five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except , and once a in the confidence that we canâ€™t do n't done have , what we dolls have .
so lucky you 're moving away now at any new diet , in any new questions can and you want in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle esg .
yes or no ?
and if you know if you .
and if no let 's just stay .
because if the end of nothing debut of it is pure regret .
it 's the habits are about decide whether we get sick to be or a healthy stay .
it 's the bad habits , we sick to do .
and it 's good habits of us healthy do .
and if mike in the mirror neuron 'll see it there 's a result of his daily lifestyle .
if mike in the mirror neuron , then see it there on hacking everyday habits .
and if mike in the mirror neuron , frankly , you 'll see it also , where it 's the road .
because if he 's more bad habits had good one then he picked up towards disease road .
and if mike in the way headed toward health towards its goals , towards its dreams then got it 's not immediately be a whole life forbid .
then you need it 's just fit more beautiful habits had bad .
and a mental habits mike 's also a super profile for that the human being seen a weird animal is .
mike does it for example able to movement completely from a charming routine by it any way to the car driving lots of darpa , any kind of elevator uses .
and night queen goes on the couch and have to somehow then started moving to go .
so , flop , he turned into his truck into protected with the bottom up what am definition se been paradox is and will then how much r-i-a-a rat back on such a band , so he somehow it back at the wave comes .
and my grandpa , you know , precisely such as you .
the was the farmer and the would n't understand .
would say , sport is for people who does n't move .
and somehow has he also quite .
why have we night in our spare time , what we in everyday have ?
strictly taken ceos are today at this lifestyle two hours sport activities per day .
pretty much hat exercises but much easier to the wave back there to find where we 're losing much .
in everyday .
and therefore ' i do today to a invite you .
may recognize also the situation , you drive night before time soon to shop , such bitter , that in the first set it 's not a place free .
and talk about seeing you look like holding programming of this one of us .
we want more of supernova due to go .
we plan our apartments -- so that we are ways very much .
we plan our whole life so that we are ways we but that leads us but not touching , where we .
but in a very different direction .
so lucky . ab now to activate and the wave back there find , where they degrees boundary .
i had abed ] example sync with the curved .
and i 'm the only , the increasingly high and down and high and down running and everybody else today .
but if i mean 've ever since i then ' i mean the time for me .
then ' i mean the motion picture , because just like teme lies .
and move from above the comes to '96 minutes , # ' i .
steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes translation .
and b has if you off now , every day , has more go then means that they end of the day 12 grams fat doesnâ€™t in your body .
this may possibly relatively little sound .
but as , as a habit established by 34 days in get socially embraced by four gifts , five pounds fat .
we 're not in our bodies have .
and you banana my degrees ' time this , i grab him still .
the americans are indeed crazy , imagine how do here .
this is a of five pounds fat .
they dated ' i four pounds .
just so you ever sees , what actually happening with these little tell you .
and if the effect of this , what my guess what just happens when you really in an active life , starting .
and these mosses , she turned off now , every day in their day-to-day .
once look at the steps per day arrived species , walk , almost all of them .
and if you 're automatically generates and time have in sports then make it 's a melody top .
then they have along the too .
then they are too fast and stronger .
but is to make your health rather more dependent of sports .
so that make your health rather more dependent upon their livelihood , and of their time .
because it 's important is important to do you now every day , as a lifestyle .
and i grab an active lifestyle .
and for me is employing more than a lifestyle , for me is a on a clear decision based for life and for me to itself .
because i think , health has n't start to do , what we do should or do reject .
but health has continued to do , what we do want .
and therefore ' i now only still an idea for them .
decide they turned off now just simply serves for the best .
and off now you know also how it goes .
stage for the stage .
thank god .
how does it 's a leonardo da vinci actually able on how incredible , kind of ways the world with other eye to see ?
and help themselves as far on the , what to his time just simply unthinkable unimaginable happened ?
we might we go upstairs today anyway ?
once maybe what happens to do ?
and how we 're motivating force and sperm to our future draw ?
start we but ever since working with the question what understand that we 're sleeping under innovation ?
yeah .
technology inventions research and development in fact , the official the federal government of the title of the federal .
so i understand you feel right .
this is yes all the great .
and we can with quite proud respond to be very thankful to be that we in hell many fields are that our around the world needed to be that we do good is to go .
that we make a so extraordinary , unique wealth built so much .
but how to see it with the future from ?
what 's challenge to go well , because when society around us to ?
and who cares , because there to the huge ecological and social challenges ?
so ' seems to sort mattered to be .
a kind of division .
so the economy sistema has to the ecological challenge because the entrepreneurs then the big effort with the we get productivity and efficiency increase .
and the world better do want to find yourself in a nonprofit organizations and leisure and and the need to then also what remained so truthful of course to get the damage the capitalist economy to bloggers .
least to repair .
but who say , because that we all perceived as separate look at need ?
how would it because if we our around the r-i-a-a social and cultural dimension extend ?
if technological innovation the same as cultural innovation are ?
if economic innovations the same as social innovation are ?
if we do think , and act sent self-assemble with the solution great and social challenges ?
if so slightly different particles unknown forces , and if we do a very different , fair developing expertise ?
because what happened ?
both sides wanted but what companies ?
can you ian ?
ask you might occasion .
yet we know more than a contradiction twists .
for the lucky there 's oakland encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus won with his , with his in bangladesh incredibly lucky cares about the poverty there .
and interestingly even more just in the hudson to the , what the federal berners-lee invented .
and he has as entrepreneurs , probably reported for the to get .
at the opportunity to show up gets me a i assure you still with anyone familiar to do .
, dare i think of .
quite 16th young guy .
super trained government , but also his administration museums .
and yes , so totally .
i love the absolutely pitch .
and if you to see , then think they oh real , in the offspring , there needs we use our future indeed , do n't worry do .
yes , immediately after graduate student it 's going somewhere here we started to work at a our .
that make it also very good .
that speaks his totally and there 's also very successful .
and yet anything behind there still so in him .
so he asks , this is actually not even more , somehow able to me behind ?
so this entrepreneurial says he then again .
are lacking in all .
and liked him too .
and his mom maybe these .
so the side because even the , the weight , he closes same haunting .
so not that he it personally know , but it from the tells him know what .
and because the middle , in the t three one-way process knew he did n't .
so even stronger than was he surprised when he 'll watch a personal imagined was .
like nelson .
and as an underdog entrepreneurs who he you 'll never imagined .
the exact great joy plutocracy , so with young people cooperate , there on his his experience posing .
and the two choices then plummeted hacker found .
and have increased still criticism met .
how would it because if we just once so in a guy talking about the two times ?
yeah ! mister , so what was imprisoned again yeah .
what is now , exactly the difference between between and companies ?
i was still not so easily understood .
yes , so , then begin we but first place at the question what 's a company ?
so the name says arthur yeah !
establishing markets , establishing products , establishing customers , establishing structures , there is a .
and you can also quite specifically projections off fossil , where you the huge entities .
and time r-i-a-a r-i-a-a , even if the quite neat is that can also refused .
what 's because then actually a ?
so , , you know so one is it first guaranteed n't it 's just not the small issue , one big company .
it 's something completely different .
it has written a completely different character .
because it has painted , nothing .
any customers , no , nothing is known .
by puppets is a a temporary organization of the purpose serve a business to seek to find out to develop the profitable of course , that but especially interested in and so , then scale out .
and you 're going certainly understand that 's obviously in such an organization everyone else entirely different ways there , everyone else entirely different methods .
yes , this is me pretty clear .
but after that 's searching we because triangles ?
so , i ' first place , then go unregulated wait there drum stays whisper of money to earn ?
so i keep praying because even degrees , that fits quite well , so seminar found in berlin defy you i recommend ?
which means .
how you your business success and after the your whole life jacket .
oh no .
real ?
what believe you because if you to start thirty your money pm : what 's because after your ?
so you get a career as or what ?
what happens then to remove engagement , as i of you know ?
and also look we but first place .
so the statistics about to give you do n't perspective , because percent are few years of speakers after in a lot of financial situation when faced your great races .
money is always the result , one successful company and one good company .
yeah , money is a source for the entrepreneurial .
and the foundation all economic .
but it 's never accomplish , one company .
yes , which is then target ?
but the company ?
so , when i do hug ' i keep ' yet learned , so without purpose is no way the right .
and so , goals rare but more concrete measurable timeline certainly be , etc .
and when i do everything there 's not keep praying , so how can i was a little search of which i do n't do n't know what i seek ? ?
so that makes me not good sense .
so how should i because somehow decide , and risks risk that stressed out for me anything like vague , and on .
yes , welcome in rural entrepreneurial .
but i keep praying because maybe what causes of you .
a thread .
so i am always , so almost always secret .
successful by generation to generation .
a for .
so , or how to tell you today ?
supposedly ' i do ?
so we say , wait always lead .
at psychotic crises and and sustainable uncertainty .
so help guaranteed .
i dated ' , i can you an accurate devices .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister .
but there are am just ask fuck .
can you same time agonizing , an important entrepreneurial qualities is good question to ask .
we can the first one after the other nerves that i might better understand ?
so the first name am i 'm here and what romantic love this difference ?
yes , , there is supposedly what moved of you about yourself beyond the bigger than you yourself ?
what you on the world ?
what did the people worldwide , if you to sing together ?
what â™« you ready to be ?
what 's your pipes , probably am not unconscious ?
why is so important thing to discover ?
because that 's also your entrepreneurial .
and how we of learned ?
if you a ship built want then not the men together bits work a hot day chatting to collect but i teach them were yearning for the cosmos , containing sea .
yes , well .
so then i let me the next questions about .
what is my ?
which means that 's because ?
yes , now taps you your goal really time .
colorful in detail , but i ' shall pop up a if you you know what you could n't want then it 's going on you hang stay .
willie you actually the story with pink elephants ?
gets me because degree program .
right ?
.
so , pass first stage .
you let 's no pink elephants ago .
okay ?
works performed know ?
so no pink elephants .
understand ?
no pink elephants .
see you ?
so going dismissed us , if we like sue focus on , what we do n't want .
what 's because actually the only way ?
there suck ?
yes , yeah , ' '' ago , what you want .
so , or maybe the on the .
but interestingly you cultured names .
incidentally , what i just mosquitos you mean ?
i keep praying you got a liter .
time , if you the .
in the lord smith .
pandemic ?
t : what to z rider kansas a .
i institute adults floppy fox jonathan labeled whale sex magazine ooh ooh .
i sang glass in 2002 master .
i do , sir .
jim i do a grave in 2002 .
lady smith .
oh , adults ?
stacey , daisy singular of adversity projecting , molly grass .
so forth .
ooh hug a museum .
economist real architectural to adults ?
and how to see figured out ?
you what noticed ?
somebody choosing anything changes ?
okay .
okay , and the flower well .
okay .
so , then let us consumes even then look let 's where the bear rainforest is .
michael .
in the lord smith .
pandemic ?
t : what to z rider kansas a .
i institute adults floppy fox jonathan labeled whale sex magazine ooh ooh .
i sang glass in 2002 master .
i do , sir .
jim i do a grave in 2002 .
lady smith .
and , how about languages spoken with it ?
so , i know yet , i was also shocked .
i was real shocked .
when i first ever seen keep praying .
i thought it might well probably not used to be .
and even more shocking was i got me through the head lost it might be that i actually the whole time goes through the area over ?
through my life .
and okay , i understand know that make am totally sense .
to dig up the immediate to prevent that we most from our perception and our lesters have .
but what matters because now actually start ?
what ' i was and what ' i left ?
and therefore , nonetheless you your perception geographic somewhere to get the r-i-a-a more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thank you 'll come we mean time to your next question .
how i can actually to my goal to go ?
so i think i r-i-a-a good question .
fg ' i catch every time as well , and know somehow not more nuanced .
yes , , because there 's oakland r-i-a-a good news for yourself .
this will you easier fall when you may yet worries shame .
because if you your clear , your inner drive and if you skip the goal very rough introduced gave promise i sing , it 's going up inside of us alone happen .
almost automatically .
you 're going to absolutely nothing else can be found a brainstorming , you concerns that stuff on immigration banjo .
that 's going to this famous , you the morning under the shower shame .
and yet r-i-a-a question recommend that i worry about the place whoa ! good enough to whom you integrate banjo whom you to advice , asking banjo to receive more input , more shifted with dallas to get .
and you copied even a big role .
the have a terrific .
di , if the longer steps knew that has in his invited us in florence .
for lunch at the famous big table .
and the orientation completely different people .
so scientists , , politicians , banker taking bribes engineers , architects and he does r-i-a-a very intense of neat .
but not in our present sense , where 96 drum went , yes , who throws himself through ?
who has right ?
but rather easily that spontaneously mix these various things that arose are so on european style , and the way one of those bacteria would imagine spraying can .
well , yes , the next question called serotonin concrete next step do i ?
actually tap into mcdonald successful entrepreneur in the reason quite easily .
rather large to plan and management and so on focus has always easy to fit on the next stage .
because what should you because in the area of uncertainty also do ?
but the lead to that really determined and with all consequence out .
and if you hug when nothing was a lawyer , dan search you wait fingertips different stage .
and even if the big , colorful , nothing was then there 's oakland wait r-i-a-a other .
therefore it is so important that you your am sure .
there 's skip the inside safe .
and in the remaining what we 've actually all slowly learned ?
although we know anything not statistically , and it even though nobody told me ?
officially `` you actually also for children .
so , this playful learn that image search and this playful searching it 's also , fun doing that in a company protest in a .
and this is also just sort of against the uncertainty , we usually always kind of power .
yes , thank nelson .
so i hear you know already quite fantastic places .
but i do n't know so , in my in the company , i dated ' there have increased still many boss change that there anything happens .
and religious reasons here in germany , there 's still so these general mood .
and i dated ' , involve breaking the politicians convenience for worried that has to change .
okay my boy , come time with .
how to go down here tear down defending the water .
what believe you , many people can you change ?
10 ?
tens ?
ten million ?
whoa first bow down .
dr. see you ?
yeah .
this is the 1950s , you can change can take you really change can .
or make it by mahatma to say , find the climate change , you in the world where you yourself .
tbp you sure beautiful words and the big models , but how should because willpower work ?
because we have to happiness another couple of on our .
helpful in the sorts of crisis , or if you fail to small gamble for something or if you a and they 've all with you to do .
and if you yourself in beijing situations achieve what hypercard of you now despite 18 fg ' â™« what 's posture you occupy can physically help of you to feel .
fg ' â™« but guess what you on facebook , over the twain shall just .
and easy to conclude that formulation ' fingertips , what you actually from this recession or death , which is bad happens is because jimmy .
so i personally , if you touch you already happening is that they figured least one .
yeah well .
nelson , thanks .
and believe you really believe me help on my entrepreneurial way ?
yeah yeah .
and shadow you especially interested in two things .
first time eighth on the clarity your inner , that going to remove entrepreneurial am going .
because it determines your perception .
and for the second eighth on your inner jeopardy '' herself facing .
well , so you like the other people who richard nixon behavior .
the future 're still only then when we our own perception change .
you spoken to ?
yes , my darling ' roll .
thank mister well then .
everything beautiful .
yes .
what hold of our ?
nice .
really , or ?
and how often we 're miserable because now supposed to this ?
is a new ?
i mean , yeah .
quite clear .
whereas i particularly interested in the ice shelf .
it 's called .
and this is what the absolutely soluble .
a from the depth .
and no , so new , .
but the .
the right before long in the great famous called .
by robert about whether or how you all welcome .
let us but just those minds to dough .
and who knows probably going to know from our the next leonardo in our time .
you see right , i am .
maybe if it so that i 'm with children and their future , because finally are year-old children with our future .
instead is the hudson river , i the most of time enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in jail .
imagine four years have my father and i have this program , entrepreneurship for prisoners , facebook .
we , which means you can look after the rail either apps to make or find for their comprehensive a workplace , and then also hold snails .
why i 'm now so worker to , so who are already failed are the big mistake did have ?
our program is overhead is not so easy to understand how programs has to kids care .
and honest told you know i thought that the the last place in the universe is , in which i work would .
what we believe that 's the most important missing factor in the kid with the people with whom we work ?
we 've figured out there are positive models often male positive models .
and if you think about why it in certain that many and many , there are often lies talk about that the father is no sensible work does that he drinks , that he drugs consumed or that he himself in jail sitting .
and if you get a young think about what he left his life make 'd made it may not any better idea , like a different lives to look could because it 's no better models given .
and he his father left .
i assure you , martin of life .
martin 's our program .
and his father was 36 , and made the whole family life to hell .
when he 12 was his mother died , and he and be small brother we had into the taliban .
there was he 's the great .
he was shy and , and so the perfect victims .
except to the day as being small brother , in a so roughly met is that these sea floor below remained .
actually helped martin first time through , he went on the enemy go and proposed to .
and releasing this day was it respects .
and so the germans go .
violence matched by now start to his life , exactly like at his father .
how about it now at the skier , i just described keep on ?
after the kid for the youth who are lots of unemployed or have .
know it 's not much different than your illegal activities and their .
and then one day they 're with people into prison closed organizations , it 's exactly how about their ideas around the same circles as any better models are .
about what i think you think these people together for , if you go together in jail chairs ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're better and criminals in .
they sell afterwards drugs on a higher level and plan before , in norway , where you 're looking at the rail minister could .
and that 's going then in germany to of percent .
which means , in germany will every second criminals jail .
then there but also people in prison , they really change want .
but also these people wear a stamp on the soviets .
and there sits down .
and everywhere , where they come to their first identity .
if you a gang looking , if you an apartment looking if they new private relationships build want to wherever they 're using this identity , with this is the stamp when you find lesions in the society that infinite hard power .
this is a problem , especially after we are .
how we 're trying to this problem to solve ?
what 's property , think they 're bringing lots of with ?
they would be surprised to be .
it 's the entrepreneurial skills .
who was a suit he has certainly idea of of and by .
announcer watch totally has performed a little , otherwise hat ' he 's not in jail landed .
these features want us for something positive forces .
we start our program with one of education in prison , in three .
we communicate the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
everyone participants write its own and anybody takes place for a comprehensive part .
and then applying we , people even after the custody at , at at your personal relationships and even at a centrifuge .
what to go up from our program butterfly ?
it 's a wide range from the opportunity for .
we have a pretty much .
a very much greater range of forcing openness , i 'm like to life .
talent and his illusion , from the rapid money did it already very early to bargain to cocaine photography .
he had been more fun reminder that stores to run .
he 's going to the first time arrested met .
and these norway got it 's not particularly impression .
throughout the contrary .
he reveals itself now , he 've pointed its second custody prepared .
he then for the second time convicted met .
he took then later on a therapy part and then at .
and there learned it as he would be a talent for some insights can .
he 's in september the rail met , he then october of his for cyborg .
the walking forwards , he can bioluminescent gene life .
he has changed very good for transplantation .
he is today with me here .
who it like to alec want to talk he died .
more time back to martin , from i asked him to blogger talked had .
martin once lived his childhood a training for the chef flop and ended up in his basketball at the .
and because alcohol , and drugs there at the agenda are used to cycle pretty soon launched .
he working in parallel when dj , and as .
twenty years , led him this life .
and he says neuroscientist , that it back with this lifestyle , to do n't have confidence has .
one day signaling he 's a person at a so hard that he 'll upgrade was .
he took the most part and there has really his life changed .
he learned how he became more force became more success and getting higher quality to go could no his to make juice or without drugs to consume .
and he was from his squeezing and so thrilled that he decided we had these want it 's like to pass .
and he wanted part of being .
this has .
he works well since the scarce two years for us and our expectations raised their way in the way freedom , because he knows ourselves that , if you feel really change like , and if you the right tools with at the hands , get that much more is possible as you often in my presentation .
the basis of these successes are the way people as you .
people , with us into prison come to external sessions with us to go to our participants in their , in your personal plans to airstream .
that 's our , the talks in our class often , that 's the students make the page .
and that 's our mentors , our participants straight down the rail sister .
and also these people take much from our program with .
an example .
we do on our events , an exercise , the site called .
we stick then in the middle of relativity a big our participants are on one of our stand on the other side .
and i was established then different question .
and the terminator , if someone in space this question with scientific answers kick it at the line up .
and here shows himself , what we all together created , whether we 're inside of sit or outside .
but also , where the differences wrong .
and an example for , where the differences wrong , is following question .
i 'm in a so-called social grew , or i had a member of what already halfway into custody was .
there are normally lots of our participants front of the line and just very few our .
a question that i like to spot , we all connects the ' i want them questions .
lead a request i think that they all the point up .
maybe we can a little light given in the audience .
i can see .
there are all .
terrific .
thank you .
i assure you now a question , and if you this question with scientific questions put it has been a while , otherwise keep you just stand .
this is kind of our production line , we now consider .
i 'm in my life illegal things done for the i would punished be able was but not .
if you this question with scientific questions put them up please .
add count , drunk car threats to be .
add count , maybe even doses amounts cocaine obsessed with very much .
add count , it with the seat not quite specifically taken to have .
okay .
and it counts as empowered , maybe each of labor n't always completely accurate signed to have .
all clear .
the most clients .
we have a few angel in space .
this is wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you 're lucky at all been glasses .
about this question , if we are on the events ask you get our very often into the cement .
and many will also clear , how much lucky you probably had very much .
happiness with the parents ' happiness with the environment , in the they behaved , with the friends , but also happiness about that they may not always been carrying caught met these are if you about the leading edge of or even about what metastases did have .
what are the results of our work ?
percent in our alumni find from within days after their a workplace .
this is rapidly quickly .
percent have increased patient chips made .
a third of donor last year they were .
and our is at seven percent .
i had been told by seven percent represents a in germany of percent attitude .
i am .
a cost in per year in formerly euros .
and it 's a nice , what kind of seven percent towards one of typically percent for a means .
when my father and i joined the gamers have , we are laid off pretty much for quite really believed met .
i keep back in my great in a big companies abandoned .
but i got to tell , i keep in my life still not such a job done .
we encourage our participants personal responsibility to take responsibility .
responsibility , what in your life happens is , especially interested in charge for taking responsibility , what in your life accidents happen .
so , not to hide anything to .
because it 's going to a whole new confidence and allow it also the undercover again trust build .
and therefore does it felt entirely especially happy and proud when our participants open by their way report .
statistical i 'm a little video brought .
film away .
so i was convicted for two years , and eight months because dangerous .
i was arrested an antidote to three years , and 10 months convicted .
i have to cocaine traded .
so , i judgment of two years getting arrested dangerous .
i was convicted because , and with .
so , through my participation in the fbi has actually my orchestra living changed .
and what for me important was that was this , well done properly .
because there was my yes , my absolute .
i was n't , ' i close to say , yeah .
i keep adding goals going eyes whoa .
i keep adding perspective discovered i keep it back home front tracking .
and you go to a whole other minds and confidence from the rail out .
yet been screwed anyway more without fixed goals and then you painted over again in anything .
with the wrong people together and now , no longer .
well yeah , this problem is that many not have , if the playwright .
the biggest problem , since then automatically viruses that you once in the old coming .
you know as well nothing else .
through that bump , however , which is showing everything was offered it does look at me just my whole mindset about me to themselves , about other , over the interacting with problems , over the interacting with the society has changed in my simple as those 20 weeks completely shot .
i 'm not been of my first woman divorce .
and been six months ' i reconnect with them together .
which means so , we have a new relationship started .
and because i feel pressure among other through this whole and many other things that changed keep praying .
a lot of keep praying , i 've achieved .
i 'm with my family back in raw language education started .
so i work today in my , ' i say .
i jazz musician peter a for the .
you must really appreciate that 's very , lots of people there are actually , like for example , my mentor , now also about these were still persist and actually about to be yes , i do n't know , engagement beyond the people sustain .
i am grateful for that they on the idea at supporting groups that they so what do .
i am grateful for that they tested with security trouble have and i am extremely grateful that i part of them to be grateful .
relativity group of course also the whole people , the support , carrying guns .
i acted as honest with many people at the events talking , and i always been confirmed that have this is good , jazz musician .
and why pat ' i swear also do .
and for conservatives ' i thank you .
they come with us into prison .
each of you have something , what we need to get .
if you our participants in their counseling , if they were able to us to get asked them in frame of a financial support about are .
if you our program in a new burden want to different subject .
speaking them we ask questions .
martin and i are now here .
and marvel of us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
i 'm at the mysterious whisper in nepal .
in one time in the i do something that satisfaction that was .
actually makes you know like this stuff .
so , for promoting .
the go .
a sabbatical in the monastery take .
there am today really many ways how to manage to be .
diversity as you interact to be .
anyway was i also buddhist .
with my work and so little bit about the .
whereas i 'm here really of memetics seriously .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was and managed to me piracy exactly what my life in 10 decades , thirty years to look going .
it was .
and this was kind of scary .
catastrophic spawning express .
in basically i had a .
administrator , as private .
i knew just not meant that i 've got the road rage ?
david perry me just lazy you ?
or what would be when i mean again to throw ?
and displayed ' what then happened .
what if you to me busy .
they were so the idea .
i was in this time free at a .
how words .
the was for me as well nonetheless , the absolute .
you free the world , inherent in very good hotels and this country on a very kind of ways .
but occasionally also very countries .
developing where it sure anymore to see and say that counts as a river villages to kindly orangutans , though they do n't have to strive happiness and joy .
yeah of those images and live but a sort of course .
and exactly this was for me after a while the crux of .
i was what i did too little .
to interpret them .
also found myself a little bit of me about a country to write to judge that i really absolutely not really know .
i wanted to myself differently .
i wanted to landscapes right vegas .
to articles write to get .
and to my personal interested to satisfy .
how to learn how countries better know ?
by you with the people live .
at the people living amongst them home .
not in the hotel .
by seeking out with the challenges and with the problems of people engaged .
and by you with the people working .
at least was the answer that i 'm on this question be able to .
and i wanted i do .
also wanted me something like to do .
i wanted a piece of theirs .
something good do .
and this sensation having a look at me , especially interested in an even more intense .
i was that existed before been times in developing but nepal gave me just a particularly touched .
until pressure where a civil society did n't just countless widow is not as numerous economic and social problems camels .
with an annual capita from 450 is nepal 's poorest country in asia .
and counting to continue to one of manufacturing poorest countries the world .
a quarter of the population lives below poverty .
almost a fifth of the population arthritis on malnutrition .
forty percent of adults could n't read and writing .
all those facts connected with very many personal stories and `` oops , i went on this going to christianity met me in one time in the i 'm ready was and frank was necessary changes .
in my own little change wanted .
and whistles stood up my return out of nepal my decision stuck .
i quit my job .
and applied me at the aid .
and i ' now , albeit briefly a 16 the answer that i went on my '' received .
because they just a was .
it comes up to a '' at international companies .
and not to a for a to wait degrees time in nepal life want to a funding your backpack .
hi ?
about touch before ?
my '' was really serious measurement and good .
at least i was .
and this answer was a .
i was really occurring .
and keep praying course , snap a fairly emotional response wrote .
and for the luck ever .
instead acted ' i this , but right intense feel took about what good to do .
i used as an engine , to my own company to reasons .
.
michael .
a company in basically exactly that offers , what i went back looking i .
namely the ability to a country unlike began traveling .
the ability to a country right meet .
by myself with the people protect yourself alive and working properly .
and although not anywhere work can not in .
you could way in two words snails .
so , and .
it means strive to how unsafe places where you good of garbage can .
this point where you good do that can .
this sounds combine a little bit .
but not .
is a bond business .
we use tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
diversity avail ourselves as a tool for sustainable development .
so , and tourism .
because the people , with us to travel contribute as their fame .
they pay for their journey , like at a different .
but they travel just different .
they live in .
and this is not a blanket lot of lions or a blanket much not juan exchange .
social engagement .
and .
add engaged into our participants had ever after and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work for a tourism , regions promote the otherwise no chance on the classic tourism would be .
because just the christmas infrastructure lead a missing .
for the other we can endure projects neurogenesis .
we can own sustainable projects enzyme and exploration .
we fund us so to a hundred percent itself .
are also not on donating depend .
and this is we just to our long-term engagement of meaning .
started we manage our work in nepal .
year we have our involvement in uganda .
and now think about four years turned around us to dominate i was married and my husband and i are also administrator a team was a question .
go to take the way forward ?
or what would if we even bigger thinking ?
if we put even more optimistic ?
if we take development not just a social engagement and sustainable journey in my but progress in his wholeness can sense ?
and so even the individual league ?
or even specialty individual .
that would then in basically a new an extra companies .
a company , look at companies manages .
with other , but the same scholars like .
want us ?
was the next question .
new business ?
certainly want us .
we love entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we are alike .
because we the same language .
because we the same wildest dreams .
because we the challenges to understand .
and so we have in this year one sister gift .
.
and to encourage our creative companies in its development and poland , we go through some outstanding people sustain .
karen bass , we are participants , entrepreneur , or collaborators from a creative companies with individual corporation .
so the personal social and intellect , of injuries .
and the way to prepare .
the there at the same again .
a drone along a meaningful yet another biosphere does .
he shows a in relatively short time on where you physically or where you .
where you may still racial weight .
where you probably too little flexible , to in thinking .
and he shows a thousand galaxies you really good .
going with his strength scared eyes .
be creativity , suddenly beekeeping terrific .
or be the dedication who you to in which has discovered .
the inner things that assume you ca n't change can .
and the power of things to change , you change can .
and you can be very much change .
already in very short time .
we know .
an example lead .
that 's rose , and .
that 's five very wonderful women from uganda .
to b , and with a talent .
you to strive beautiful , years ago .
and since the 1990s happened , nothing .
because they simply no market solution had .
because they never knew how the quality better understanding .
because you ca n't told me , which the design might in the question arises .
we wanted to these women help .
and have adopted in this year as a company .
.
products of people out of poverty partners .
you an income going .
a future enable .
we 're yesterday with our live gone .
and we start with a des .
one of thousands of our women .
the sales get you ca n't fit for a year an income .
not allow us as well , this project still much larger to do .
those initial bacterial bond and in one .
so who secretly want to be this for a with the purchase a chain to make for others can he but with us either directly into the project journey .
he can to the women journey , and physically active .
long-term want to do we 're not just five women a task must not fifty or a hundred .
and it 's not only in uganda , but also in nepal and in other areas where we work .
help but this is just a project from our integrated cycle of projects .
we 're working in all of central areas .
in the area of sciences partners and shoots .
because the work in just a field just too little .
what happens with the kids when the women working ?
yeah .
therefore we have in this year in nepal and in uganda even two company .
it reaches into our cycle fold .
and all make even more sense , as every single project for themselves .
collaborator thermostat , we ever went into the various projects .
the exact molecular biology arise around and then still only in the collective work .
and finally graduated i 'd you now more directly on a going to take .
and pioneer ants i give the eyes to close .
' '' before you ready in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a .
and sooner satisfied and tired .

â™« â™« innovators and happy .
you chase the eyes once you to do .
each of us how to meet up on something new .
or at least for a short time , dice again to to throw .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i ah , would me interested , whether of you today night , you here 's a long time someone home occupied weight .
i carry with the light not so really good , but perhaps want to remember someone smallpox .
here , down ' i person .
two .
here for the top ' i 'm afraid no , but on every case here , down are long time two , this is beautiful , we 're a long time to .
i keep ' husband as a building warps and although the mountain in east of the city .
this is this building .
along with 20 different individuals figured ' i in the last summer six months of years purposeful .
and therefore ' i now , tonight show up at them .
well , like now some of you might say .
what should screwed anyway ?
there 's uh oh lot .
but i want to quickly explain .
oh what you occupied the moment ?
and you get national park or how ?
just a little choice of questions , our souls , friends , colleagues asked you 've got your experience , have that i part of an initiative with i belong to do something called am .
all expected , that we transition in the number of had .
and somewhere around that democracies had a girlfriend and trauma suspended had .
and fight against the privatization of this stop protesting .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of .
and it was also not the earth initiative .
what we see here 's a sign from the passage in .
this is a public space , the arrival private , and therefore for many people do n't have to freely available , ' i do n't say , but what sylvia 's not in public hand and therefore not so used to be able to how to public spaces may uses .
we were a group of eternity in the request with and , sensitive and sustainable deal .
and we wanted a different story .
we were a team and i have now very quickly vegetation , because it was a very team .
from the areas architecture , planning social entrepreneurship , politics -- and statistics , diplomacy , music , photography , and .
obviously the same as well with different social and cultural and personal .
our perspectives , and itself .
and have enables us , on different skills , but also on various networks .
and creative shorter solutions in the , the we then experiments have to realize .
we really appealed to occupy .
but avoided costs us why that we are with stories and ideas , occupy .
we 're looking memories and images asked .
and from those memories and images out of trying to avoid outlook for the to develop .
about it was we important that the process still remains .
we as an initiative ourselves we 've learned compassionately as platform and as painful .
it was a and emotional occupy and was looking at home to a .
on the experiences that we learned did have to ' i now , tonight risk .
every city empty places .
the toughest neighborhood a face to give .
in many cases reported this timeless and and getting into the consequence of citizens got stranger places pure .
they 're dead places a city because they vibrate often miss the professions , what we in a public space expect .
so for example that we have to have .
i 'm going to this , but also the fact , public urban places neglected , it this often .
initiatives , such places revive want to stay often also interested already in the trouble .
what does it also with me to do you may see some questions like some outside questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places to give our city not just a face .
no .
they are the social sites in our city , in our lives bye .
so relationships that we 're cooking times first of ties to our neighbors , if we happened on the way to shop meet .
and find these forbid , if we regenerate an r-i-a-a ability to have to sit , and we actually middle-class , if the spaces also navigating designers are .
and we aim for longevity filaments that have .
structural features relationships , sometimes .
what but with security 're going is a sense of community .
more encounters , i learned in such a public space keep praying wealthier faster and more likely 're going acts as well , this community .
and when i 'm not , then you 're hiring , what you probably the notions of a 250 called .
we stood then premise two challenges .
we can at the citizens aware of responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood crowds , or in also be .
how can protest in the creation converted to be ?
how to be included in the ideas , converted to be ?
protest against the privatization of these places and criticism against the expansion and actually also do n't ethically in preserving the same places .
imagine you now , you here we sit , even before they beat the newspaper on and read following text .
love and citizens , we invite you a we want to give three possible varieties for the one of life of an earlier carefully designed housing .
they allowed in conducted at the idea was a low-cost choose .
and the variation on the most will then implemented .
if you easter ?
it would anyone of them to this event going ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounded just first great .
there r-i-a-a way , what .
they allowed , like in the future looks .
and how words sound just first great in the first moment .
i trial ' i still remember one explanation .
and although , because i of view am lucky n't do n't really or allies , or , .
first because classic often much too late .
which means mostly they have absolutely no opportunity to really own suggestions to make or indirectly alternatives to argue , but there are actually been r-i-a-a design and they allowed 'll decide whether or in the urban green plants .
or , like a friend recently , he said , what 's paint the trash people for example .
second explanation classic is rarely discuss information and vote s.o.s .
think about three varieties .
we see what you want to do we 'll show and they allowed then vote .
frustration and are often the following what i also kind through nih .
i cried like any decision about or decisions when i really prefer r-i-a-a â™« curb instead had imagined .
it comes but also different .
although we are the absence of a lot of talking cost has we finally , a lot of experience .
communal choices we experience atlanta , and i 'd already for other parts .
i want to pass on the other initiatives , at the other projects , but also , or mostly interested in at the and at the politics .
because of silly ones who are , like this actually implement should and the really responsible for those small-scale processes are .
every aspect really interested of a remote participation made , how many times , and vint 's going to get the needs we and then you need new .
not a dusty ' i but also at all right now this boat .
and flexibility and so , because i for very important movement .
i threw award for important that they all of ecuador , and i want to our like , encourage student still a chance to be .
and i embassy me at all , because you who are at the a new possibilities .
we so i have negotiations look around at the citizens aware of responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood and attachment of participation and to ?
first willingness to have this dialogue in .
in decisions practitioners at the citizens on and varied interests slices .
what we see here 's a , to where we invited everybody .
what we see here are some and in conversation with citizens .
the goal must be sure that all these conversations on revolutions , so that 's not the interests , or the skills across the skills of citizens are .
the citizens fake place are experts , they 're experts to their neighborhood you know what you missing , which you with a place fuse into what tradition of a local menu and also , what you fake place missing .
the , especially interested in the city can submit , what sea level in this project incorporate should .
in alisa or in in a particular case can get more frederick to be the issues gadgets , the biomass on this project 's ever after .
it 's going to a , in which all information for all available are and then the place fair to be able to .
by maybe even trace get to be able to an identification of pakistan possible .
a contemporary manner which means also that the wishes of residents actually serious taken action .
and although even then , if somebody says , i want a along the .
that might naturally harmony nonsense to be , but the goal must be in dialogue with all of natalie , which is the right solution , and maybe in then also in bulgaria , but maybe at a different place .
as i said , got out of the dialogue out gradually evolve .
second point that are diverse .
our 's colorful .
one feels at completely comfortable , when he introduces a major groups interdependent , and talk to be .
some others can confirm good writing , like but the text then not particularly great group to speak .
some other draw might prefer or photographing it .
or to build his ideas in on .
what i say want to have different planets around various user fair to be .
we have here for example of the way , just to come up being exposed to just first baseball , what happens .
in the background r-i-a-a small exhibition .
we have this opportunity had to be .
we have the opportunity had to paint .
we have the opportunity had to write .
independent from the age .
that was a girl .
we had the ability to our ideas to faces to connect to play ideas to .
but the way outside of up to engage you should always been given to be .
can for example about a dieting might think about fingertips happen .
and transparent availability of the results of nurture the dialogue under the commons .
we even have the whole process parallel on facebook dolby and on a bit independent blog and the same news about a distributed .
our third point .
you remind you may remember that i said that often too late identities .
at my event there were dismissed already three finished .
the process but only then when it measures protest and the in ideally even more n't do n't know what to area happen ?
if through the dialogue , and so i 'm back to watch the point number proteins that 's what 's scenarios for an area in the question to go .
part way too for themselves .
and independent stores , if not from first place hemisphere is that the event like , and so cute , which has not on the experiences from the previous alliances .
what happens now , if you the citizens your city ownership and your city .
is already in numerous projects to see .
i keep praying to show an example from , that is the , is probably at many here we know .
in new york was just a project launched , there is rising costs about a .
in are showing oyster about six weeks of dollars along came to the funding able to make should or at least .
the time has written in august wrote the politics could n't do n't have different than the idea to their own to do .
well , in new york , to the i dated ' i no longer have to say , because it 's the perimeter to one of the most of the city became it was no idea of politics or managing .
contrary , the for the beginning already superior .
in , so we are echoes back in germany have the citizens already plans to eventually spawned again .
the city was then put this is not necessary .
the four weeks , we mysterious whisper , have the 'm totally unlike coal .
today is the city offline .
during the hand ; d e wonderful work and the city , the initiative , they actually formed whole , and other miller .
paint citizens their own crossing in the street .
in rotterdam formed a .
everything well as far , like you now say .
then do we but now just , etc .
but i hold it for fake , the city from the responsibility to grow .
why ?
for a , because you know a glimpse to touch all have or we should .
during the outrageous and yell it citizens initiatives , or company itself in the rule on a for them in preserving form of litigation part of focus has the city against the responsibility for projects , as leading edge of attention to embrace .
and for the other kind of course , even if the city of projects assumes that are other tools to provide .
an initiative that can make all of integrity .
also our goal was the way a temporary initiative for their exercise planned that was about a half year buying the results and the responsibility on the city acceptance wanted .
hippo stood up a has the in january bought .
it walk again negotiation .
therefore we unfortunately in the second problem that we have responsibilities before not branded could .
but we know on every case , now know that , if the city has successfully , if the negotiation that actually successful ones that if an olympic trials .
in the adolescent form of protest is , but more open .
in order to conclude to come i am firmly believe that many projects , because of their importance of complexity or whatever their expense of the city built will need to have a chance satisfaction approval of identification to create .
if you all bets , and in dialogue with the citizens elsewhere .
in each of like a city and citizens .
in each of like a city and you all , you today tonight show sit .
if we our constitution libya and the same study decision-making process of the citizens are no longer than annoying perceive , rather than .
this was miserable .
eeg tonight for the were we here in iraq and are the way into contact .
we have about bullshit .
so that idea , even r-i-a-a second chance to have , if it in this live longer subject , then just another time r-i-a-a second chance .
we found that we 're very exciting .
and we were but fairly soon we agree that 's two things that there , we do n't even taste experience wanted .
one is adolescence .
second , there was also immediately unit bedside table more time in the school ?
senate .
senate .
school , some of you remind you may still out .
in my job so now 4,000 years ago , but the words lead in my tracker to the hands .
my neck , this together and i want to just return on december .
and then you know i do n't know how it at them was but in my exams that was then over the world with a serious basically has been sitting still beside me .
no idea , everything from the fact become .
you 'll understand , so , my threaten was really not beautiful and after i then my final behind me he was completely clear , never once in school .
and what should i now say , when i went on this year , some of the nicest days , i actually spent keep praying to keep praying , i in schools spent .
with huge passion and completely volunteer .
how come continents contributed ?
how could happen ?
started 14 times is to think that something happens is , nigeria , i 'm not at handling could .
i got kids .
so , my wife was the kids .
and therefore it was then also very clear that pore is that turned around these to care nurse .
except to the one day , when she said , honey is .
and now , reminds you while .
yes , .
heavens opened my door and then sitting i got amazon in this and i felt in the .
this was just like this looks like it back at we looked .
and smelly too much like how schools back smelly , and i belong to me , human being here has increased kidney real change .
and when i then the teacher 'll say , lo and you know , yes , the kids learn not for the school , but for graduate live there 's ' i thought , oh my god , the sentence keep praying , i am time certainly not .
what 's what we look at school , from this threaten supposed to touch life really atlanta have ?
so many of us have there really good learned .
where they have actually in your life long time really good need to get ?
and probably know some more like the capital of nationalism means .
what 's more time nationalism ?
or , this ability within short time , extracting much know where they 're just , so i handed down button again , can , except me bad happen ?
well , i keep praying that time needed to have , but otherwise ?
and what does a from one gifts one about it out whether someone once a good doctor 's going ?
if the and if the nice characteristics which has ?
senate .
so the senate , for graduate life , not for the school teaches us .
if we 're much envy , like years , the middle of century , there may well voted have .
this is the time , in the in germany , then eventually completely systematically destroyed .
and where it also did hungary , how we do today , which has its roots weight .
and if we were back of life , then it was actually so , the people back the had no access to understand their time .
and there were these four or six years , the amazon posed moments , in the school to go back to know crammed were both get really the only way , who had to deal with knowledge and the facts and the information of their time in contact to come .
today has a more information in his pocket and when the largest library of tapestries were .
and the middle of century , that was the time .
which means , because liberals care arrangements changes in the world and there were suddenly people needs of these new machines unfamiliar situation .
the same time were but also people needs of these machines wait and repair could .
and we needed to people , these machines construct could and those facilities .
may recognize it already .
in hungary , we now in germany at many questions still have , has its root in this time .
and has actually potentially make sense done .
well , because it back , probably really like this was , what i 'm in the school actually learned keep praying for the work on assembly well yeah , who end of assembly status quo because his whole life .
do we whisper glimpse into the future .
let us this century , where it is , and look we have this year on .
this year was this year , there was the first just shortly before to make balloon .
i was with my studies done and thought , now is the time , yet leaked â™« â™« chips , the first company .
yes , after some to me to estimate how to the internet , then ' i then ' i now also time left .
and some corporations are at us , they were getting bigger and getting bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are going on us again so essentially free fall .
you look at over two times in life .
and we had then after some years , but thirty employees .
so , we had such a nice growth and we had so exciting careers on board , like , .
i do n't know , if they r-i-a-a concrete idea , have what these people do but when i in the school fees did we are no idea that it so what ever give it would .
even when i made it was of like something like the internet still not talking about .
and the kids , we now in the school send particles job getting into 10 to fifteen to 20 or thirty years have ?
the electromagnetic honest answer , we have no idea .
and choose to know , surprising facts are the need to in this future jobs successful to be ?
and if they deceive these are also showing the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we degrees so in the future future who could afford because the for the saturday campus .
there fingertips â™« ' i read .
well yeah , you see , you have no idea .
how to work we get out , what school professor yochai lives learning out ?
what are the things that we need to kids for graduate life fit to do ?
and probably helps as a glimpse into school , what companies today is hiring employees seek .
that 's pronounced of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools , colleges go get into the company .
and if you feel so the r-i-a-a classic administrator clear to get standing up at first place yes , so what , like the expertise .
because you want to yes , so i read you get so , we seek fingertips , with 10 years , and those 12 years sitting abroad .
this is going to school , now , and even in the future ca n't afford life-saving .
what school but maybe barely afford could , are the things , the more important to be , that 's like this so-called and i 'm holding them convinced that these are the future will be .
and you could basically in three newspapers summarize .
this is for a company wish on the employees , the flexible they 're so flexibility is a .
then wishes come up almost all companies employees to think .
and then wishes come up these companies employees , who are .
we have so flexibility in thinking and .
start we do with the flexibility on .
this is relatively quickly nonsense .
if we look like business now works , how fast , yes , as soon move anything changes .
well all models are from the internet of today on the morning on the head ago .
there southern ' i employees , with this change interact can .
there southern ' i employees , the creative stuff .
there southern ' i employees , who are .
this is pretty carefully at the opposite of the thing in the factory late 19th century of employees end of assembly bathing had .
but the second issue is this entrepreneurial think that 's fairly obvious .
there is rising costs about the responsibility .
there is rising costs about people , the responsibility responsibility .
first time for themselves and their own life .
but also for large scale .
if we now this company or even when society wish we humans are responsible responsibility for large scale .
and the third factor that 's almost most frequently .
and if we at the football , remember , then there miserable because the web of these beautiful writer .
argentina did whisper in portugal has and germany has a team .
it was n't have gained weight .
that could fit together to do .
and even as someone , this big our time , steve jobs , yes , .
it was not the iphone invented has , who has not the invented has zeros n't invented has nothing jews invented .
who had a team , this is able to be done has , because just as a team could do what they managed so much .
so the r-i-a-a school , these three things youngsters could get biologic but r-i-a-a school , in the we care costs lives learning .
but there are still fingertips fourth point , which is me almost more important .
and this is the learner himself .
if only , what we about the future with safety saying to get is that uncertainty is then surely the ability to always been edited to learn and enjoyed about to have this learning to experience the reason that we in examined life , and that our children in examined lives reasonably are .
this hat ' yet r-i-a-a school , these things impression .
but where it was me ?
i sat in this and most of you have kids know that 's not just r-i-a-a event , for you pay have .
so the r-i-a-a event after the slogan almost everything short but still not from each other .
except to the time , where chosen to be there are then suddenly all the invisible .
yes , i sat there and what should i say , at one of my kids were these viruses were articles parts of the event .
less enjoyable it was for me when father , if you so the stress around the subject homework and learn the entire romance .
and even less fun makes a rectangle , if this child sick going , because in the school stress chaos .
and finally ended these or was a peak of this at this school also been so .
just took it was also not a , it was rather like a , so straight down the last hour and in japan proved that we also the single parents were invited were .
and i assure you now , and also liked the details lamp after cattle became clear , we need to our child there is absolutely not .
are but two years , in which we put buckets , have actually works anything not .
what do we really wrong ?
and we did we actually the question question is our child broken ?
and we are alone , where it is how about ?
meanwhile keep praying , i in the last two years since i 'm in the subject attending to very many people talking to keep [ neurogenesis , the senate , i keep praying learned , â™« â™« not alone .
there is out there are very much , where it 's quite similar issue and this was before two years , there sitting i do with together we were just carrying a new business for reasons , last night let bailout , where the journey because sooner at night sitting here at the bar and get us beyond private things .
and what should i say , he gave me almost the same story told to a his kids once he almost same experiences as we , and we were fortunate that we our children there could look at school , yeah ?
in berlin , there are secular r-i-a-a at various schools and we could actually into account cities .
but can anyone coming out to do ?
somehow was let 's too little , just our children in moscow to bring and these monopoly , there is out how to be to let 's how they are .
and after we both now the impression had to school has changed since we there were not so really changed we thought , yeah well , we are the first , the subject , now let problems .
just how shall we got there anything change ?
good is that we deceive you 've .
we 're not alone .
but we did relatively quickly r-i-a-a whole series of great people found , which includes wanted to how we , namely r-i-a-a school to do that all of commons prosperity goes .
it 's am not so that all the kids and their parents suffered the pain , which is coming out often happens .
if we are teachers look at '96 percent of teachers have .
if we look like at the number of in the last 10 years , changing entertainment industry has doubled .
can now , to that all parents that 's wrong to do ?
that all children broken are and that even those teachers broken are ?
or might be that we have a textbook , have just no longer it fits like this years ago , the fit just as well no longer as properly .
and we have many people found , where do similar went and we 've even people found that are n't have kids .
and they 've understood that they responsibility dictatorships have to the future will take responsibility dictatorships have to the future , by taking responsibility responsibility for what we our children and the children , the moment in the school going to take on the way to give .
and we have focused on the second position , there are coming out r-i-a-a whole series of great initiatives , the school , change want , and there are there are schools , here and there really neat and there are almost feels every school teacher , really firm stance and slightly change want .
and there are actually the one or another bold principal , you 'll also the first step to go .
and how should we now as to help ?
we had am no idea that we actually now about helping could .
but we can one thing to do we can in those schools go and we can remember those schools in the people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students doing yoga and we can manage those in two days r-i-a-a whole bunch move .
there to go so people together , in the past more like against working have to learn in two days , what it means connected to work .
come with quite concrete challenge the common problems .
and after two 31 days have to go for example , a new built or the ice sheet for the r-i-a-a completely new worker as we started a berlin school right now applying option .
or have a concrete actions for the problems , it into their school , have built .
inside of two days british built approaches , the volcano next day immediately goals going to get .
what but this is what about these two days happens , and that make it for me then as beautiful few weekends , i keep praying , then also measure various schools in different germany to spend , is this energy , actually emerges when the three things that learning .
if the three things together experience , namely so what you about flexibility .
so amazon thinking and when you as a team experience .
then is such a spark of the .
and if we four weeks after such a workshop place , so the r-i-a-a school return 'll experience , we found out of the school as a whole started having to change that there r-i-a-a completely new culture universe is .
and this is incredibly .
and i ' time invite to through school to think .
i ' time invite you about school biology .
and i assure you 're particularly interested in maybe invite you about riverside school , to speak .
talk about what you liked , but talk too close , what you , not liking .
they would be surprised to be , how much they get and how many people that same until recently , but just did n't suck talk .
let 's let 's every single school in germany mobilized its century to put it .
let 's all education , change .
and let 's a common do with the people in the school day for day streams , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because all together we can do .
thank you beautiful .
